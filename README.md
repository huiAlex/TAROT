# TAROT
This the repository for our ASE'2022 paper "Using Consensual Biterms from Text Structures of Requirements
and Code to Improve IR-Based Traceability Recovery".
In this paper, TAROT is proposed to improve IR-based requirement traceability recovery through using consensual biterms extracted from requirements and code, 
which can also be combined with other enhancing strategies to promote their performance.

## Running TAROT
 * Please run `main()` in `Start.java`. 
 * You can choose different evaluated systeme (9 projects) and IR models (e.g., VSM, LSI, and JSD).

## Dataset 
* The dataset used in TAROT was released by [CLUSTER-PRIME](https://github.com/huiAlex/CLUSTER-PRIME).
* You can run `BitermExtract.java` to get biterms from requirement texts.
