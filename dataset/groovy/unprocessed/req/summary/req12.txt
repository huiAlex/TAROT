New GDK method: Object.contains().
We treat arrays as Lists in may respects. There are methods from List that have been grafted unto arrays however there is no  contains()  method which would come in handy in scenarios like the following one
if (!arrayOfObjects.contains(element)) {
arrayOfObjects &lt;&lt; elements
}
One way to do it currently is this
if ( !(element in arrayOfObjects) ) {
arrayOfObjects &lt;&lt; elements
}
Notice the additional () around the expression .
