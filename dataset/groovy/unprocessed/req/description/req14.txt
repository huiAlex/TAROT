Groovy should support annotations on local variable declarations. It is syntactically legal to annotate a local variable, but the AST produced does not carry that annotation.
My use case with the AST builder. Either we d like to annotate a local variable, like this:
@AstSource(CompilePhase.CONVERSION)
def source = { println   compiled on: ${ new  Date()}   }
Or annotate a property within a closure (which is a  DeclarationExpression ), like this:
def result =  new  AstBuilder().build {
phase = CompilePhase.CONVERSION
@AstSource
source = { println   compiled on: ${ new  Date()}   }
}
A  getAnnotations()  method should probably be added to  DeclarationExpression  to support this.  .
