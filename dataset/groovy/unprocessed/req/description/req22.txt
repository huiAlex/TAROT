When writing one-liners in other scripting languages it is very helpful sometimes to automatically have access to an array containing the current line split according to a pattern. This patch adds a commandline option -a that implements this. It takes on optional parameter, the split pattern. If not used, the split pattern is     (a single space).
The patched file is GroovyMain.java .
