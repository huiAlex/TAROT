find(groovy.lang.Closure closure) and findAll(groovy.lang.Closure closure) methods are really useful. It would be also good to have
List#indexOf(groovy.lang.Closure closure)
List#indexOf(int startIndex, groovy.lang.Closure closure) // startIndex tells from which index to start looking
int List#indicesOfAll(groovy.lang.Closure closure) // return type may also be a List&lt;Integer&gt; or whatever
List#lastIndexOf(groovy.lang.Closure closure)
in the groovy jdk as it is sometimes important to know where the elements fullfilling the given condition are in the list.
