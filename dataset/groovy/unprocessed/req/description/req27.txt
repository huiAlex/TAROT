Provide a way to get the result of the  addition  of 2 Maps, eg:
assert   +  ==
In terms of Map semantics, which would take priority for duplicate keys, left or right?
Considering Java s Map.putAll(), which blindly adds all elements in the given map, perhaps the right side, should take precedence, so:
assert   +  ==
What do others think?
