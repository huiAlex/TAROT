Following the discussion at  , this AST Transformation allows transparent script interruption when the worker thread is interrupted. It adds thread interruption checks on several points of code :
closures
different types of loops
method first statement
The attached file is a preliminary implementation which does not propagate to the CompilationUnit yet (haven t found how to do it properly) + a simple script which I use for tests.
Feel free to review, patch,...   .
