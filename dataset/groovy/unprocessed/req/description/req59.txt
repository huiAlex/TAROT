I suggest to introduce a new AST transformation @InheritConstructors which can be placed on a class and the class with this annotation will inherit all the constructors of its super class.
For example:
class A {
A() {}
A( int  arg) {}
A( String  arg) {}
}
@InheritConstructors
class B  extends  A {}
Then class B will be equal to:
class B  extends  A {
B() {  super () }
B( int  arg) {  super (arg) }
B( String  arg) {  super (arg) }
}
I think it is useful, especially for defining exceptions. .
