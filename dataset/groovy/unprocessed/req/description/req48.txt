The new @Bindable annotation is great. It (further) reduces the amount of boilerplate code required in Groovy beans. The next logical step is an @Identity annotation that can be applied to one or more attributes, telling Groovy that those properties define the identity / business key / whatever-you-want-to-call-it of the bean. The object s equals(), hashCode() and toString() would behave accordingly.
