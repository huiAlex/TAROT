As described in a thread in the groovy user list here:
An implementation of  groupBy  that receives a list or an array of closures as criteria for grouping would be useful for making nested groupings.
def grouped = ,
,
,
,
].groupBy({ it.aa }, { it.bb })
def expected = , ]],
22:], 33:]],
33:]]
]
assert  grouped == , ]
assert  grouped == ]
assert  grouped ==  null
groupBy  with one closure criterion would behave like the current implementation of  groupBy . .
