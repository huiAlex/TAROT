When executing a command-line script e.g., via -pe it would sometimes be very useful to define a method BEGIN and a method END which are executed exactly once, BEGIN before the loop starts, and END after the loop has ended for all files to be processed. An example:
groovy -a -ne  def BEGIN()
{c=0}
;def END()
{println c}
;c += split &#91;0&#93; .toInteger()+split &#91;-2&#93; .toInteger()  test.txt
results in:
39
for the following test.txt:
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5 6
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
The patch provides this functionality and additionally that of   and  . If a singular patch is necessary, I ll be happy to provide it. .
