Groovy provides a very convenient encodeBase64 method in byte. It would be even more convenient if there were also an encodeHex method in byte. See
.html#encodeBase64()]
The Apache Commons Codec project provides an implementation of a hex encoder but it would also be trivial to implement from scratch. This feature would be immensely convenient when working with checksums.
