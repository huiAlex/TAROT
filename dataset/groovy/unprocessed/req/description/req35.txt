I am trying to use XmlSlurper to process and xml with nested elements with text in them.  I need to get the text from just one level at a time but the text() method returns all text for all childrend and I can t see anything that would bring back just the local.
Here is a sample from the console:
groovy&gt; def model = new XmlSlurper().parseText( &lt;aModel&gt;&lt;aParent name= bubba &gt;text&lt;aChild&gt;child text&lt;/aChild&gt;&lt;/aParent&gt;&lt;/aModel&gt; )
groovy&gt; model.aParent &#91;0&#93; .text()
groovy&gt;
groovy&gt;
Result:  textchild text  .
