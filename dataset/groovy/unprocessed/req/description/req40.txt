Currently we have list*.method() that invokes the method on all items in the list.
It would be useful to also support list**.method() that invokes the method on all items in the list and recursively for any lists within the list.
def animalLists= , ]
assert  animalLists.size() == 2
assert  animalLists*.size() ==
assert  animalLists**.size() == , ]
.
