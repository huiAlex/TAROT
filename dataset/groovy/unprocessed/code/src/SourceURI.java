/**
 * Variable annotation used for getting the URI of the current script.
 * <p>
 * The type of the variable annotated with {@code @BaseScript} must be assignment compatible with {@link java.net.URI}.
 * It will be used to hold a URI object that references the source for the current script.
 * </p><p>By default the URI
 * will be made absolute (which is to say it will have an authority) in the case where a relative path was used
 * for the source of the script.  If you want to leave relative URIs as relative, then set <code>allowRelative</code>
 * to <code>true</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>
 * {@code @groovy.transform.SourceURI} def sourceURI
 *
 * assert sourceURI instanceof java.net.URI
 * </pre>
