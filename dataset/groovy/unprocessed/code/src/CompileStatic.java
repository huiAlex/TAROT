/**
 * This will let the Groovy compiler use compile time checks in the style of Java
 * then perform static compilation, thus bypassing the Groovy meta object protocol.
 * <p>
 * When a class is annotated, all methods, properties, files, inner classes, etc.
 * of the annotated class will be type checked. When a method is annotated, static
 * compilation applies only to items (closures and anonymous inner clsses) within
 * the method.
 * <p>
 * By using {@link TypeCheckingMode#SKIP}, static compilation can be skipped on an
 * element within a class or method otherwise marked with CompileStatic. For example
 * a class can be annotated with CompileStatic, and a method within can be marked
 * to skip static checking to use dynamic language features.
