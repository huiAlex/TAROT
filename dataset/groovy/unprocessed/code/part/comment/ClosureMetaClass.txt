/**
 * A meta class for closures generated by the Groovy compiler. These classes
 * have special characteristics this MetaClass uses. One of these is that a
 * generated Closure has only additional doCall methods, all other methods
 * are in the Closure class as well. To use this fact this MetaClass uses
 * a MetaClass for Closure as static field And delegates calls to this
 * MetaClass if needed. This allows a lean implementation for this MetaClass.
 * Multiple generated closures will then use the same MetaClass for Closure.
 * For static dispatching this class uses the MetaClass of Class, again
 * all instances of this class will share that MetaClass. The Class MetaClass
 * is initialized lazy, because most operations do not need this MetaClass.
 * 
 * The Closure and Class MetaClasses are not replaceable.
 * 
 * This MetaClass is for internal usage only!
