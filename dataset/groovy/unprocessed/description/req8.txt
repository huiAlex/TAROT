With regards to a thread in the groovy user list here:
A  take( n )  method would be a really useful addition to the Groovy codebase
It is assumed it will work similar to other languages, in that:
def a =
assert  a.take( 0 ) ==
assert  a.take( 1 ) ==
assert  a.take( 4 ) ==
The method should work for  Collection ,  String ,  Map  and lazily for  Iterator ,  Reader  and  InputStream  .
