GPath syntax doesn t support xml with namespaces. The XmlParser class creates special names for xml elements with namespaces (e.g.,
{namespace-uri-here}
elementName ). GPath node selection doesn t support this format.
As xml namespaces are commonly used all over the xml world, Gpath would benefit using in a transparent way all nodes, whether with binded namespaces or not. .
