When retrieving an node from an XML there is no easy way to clone this node for further processing without changing the original XML.
Currently I used a workaround:
def clonedNode =  new  XmlParser().parseText( XmlUtil.serialize( xmlNode ) )
It would be a lot easier if the Node object have a copy constructor or clone would be supported.
