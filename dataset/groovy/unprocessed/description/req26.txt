Deleting a directory including all subdirectories is a very tedious task. A method in File like  deleteRecursively()  would really help.
I am currently using already qutie nice code like this:
def dataDir = new File( ... path ...)
def dirs =
dataDir.eachFileRecurse {
if (!it.isDirectory()) log.info( Deleting $
{it.name}: ${it.delete()} )
else dirs &lt;&lt; it
}
dirs.reverse().each { log.info( Deleting directory: ${it.name}
: $
{it.delete()}
) }
But why could it not be new File ( ... dir ...).deleteDir() or similar? .
