In File s some convenient methods like File#eachLine(), File#splitEachLine() and others, there is no way to specify the encoding for reading.
For example, there is no  File#eachLine(String charSet, Closure c)  method.
Of cource, we can write:
new  InputStreamReader( new  FileInputStream( new  File(  file_to_read.txt  )), charSet).eachLine {
..
}
but this is not so groovy.
My proposal is, to add encoding() method to java.io.File as a GDK enhancement method, which can be used like:
new  File(args).encoding(  utf-8  ).eachLine {
println it
}
As reference, if write it by EMC, the definition of method encoding is like:
File.metaClass.encoding = { cs -&gt;
new  InputStreamReader( new  FileInputStream(delegate), cs)
}
GDK of java.io.InputStreamReader has equivalents each* methods, this is enough. .
