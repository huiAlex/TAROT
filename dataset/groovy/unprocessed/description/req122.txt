It would be great to have an alternate form of min()/max() where closure returns a value to be compared, rather than a comparison.  I m often trying to choose the  most desirable  element of a list, and I have some expression that computes the desirability.  Right now I have to do:
mylist.max
{x,y | my_desirability_expression(x) &lt;=&gt; my_desirability_expression(y) }
That s wordy because I need to write the desirability expression twice, and I also need to have explicit arguments for the closure.  It would be great if there were a  maxv  where I could write:
mylist.maxv
{ my_desirability_expression(it) }
maxv for  maximum of value.   Similarly with minv.
This is trivial to implement; here s what I use (a global function):
def minv (l, Closure f) {
return l.min
{ x, y | f(x) &lt;=&gt; f(y) }
} .
