    <ClassComment>MonitoredUDF  /** 
 * Describes how the execution of a UDF should be monitored, and what  to do if it times out. &lt;p&gt; NOTE: does not work with UDFs that implement the Accumulator interface &lt;p&gt; Setting a default value will cause it to be used instead of null when the UDF times out. The appropriate value among in, long, string, etc, is used. The default fields of these annotations are arrays for Java reasons I won't bore you with. &lt;p&gt; Set them as if they were primitives: &lt;code&gt;@MonitoredUDF( intDefault=5 )&lt;/code&gt; &lt;p&gt; There is currently no way to provide a default ByteArray, Tuple, Map, or Bag. Null will always be used for those. &lt;p&gt; Currently this annotation is ignored when the Accumulator interface is used.
