/**
 * Generates the average of a set of values. This class implements
 * {@link org.apache.pig.Algebraic}, so if possible the execution will
 * performed in a distributed fashion.
 * 
 * AVG can operate on any numeric type.  It can also operate on bytearrays,
 * which it will cast to doubles.    It expects a bag of
 * tuples of one record each.  If Pig knows from the schema that this function
 * will be passed a bag of integers or longs, it will use a specially adapted version of
 * AVG that uses integer arithmetic for summing the data.  The return type
 * of AVG will always be double, regardless of the input type.
 * 
 * AVG implements the {@link org.apache.pig.Accumulator} interface as well.
 * While this will never be
 * the preferred method of usage it is available in case the combiner can not be
 * used for a given calculation
