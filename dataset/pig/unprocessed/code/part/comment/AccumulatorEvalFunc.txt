/**
 * This class is used to provide a free implementation of the EvalFunc exec function given
 * implementation of the Accumulator interface. Instead of having to provide a redundant
 * implementation, this provides the base exec function for free, given that the methods
 * associated with the Accumulator interface are implemented. For information on how to
 * implement Accumulator, see {@link Accumulator}.
