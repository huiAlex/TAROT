/** Merge Join indexer is used to generate on the fly index for doing Merge Join efficiently.
 *  It samples first record from every block of right side input. 
 *  and returns tuple in the following format : 
 *  (key0, key1,...,position,splitIndex)
 *  These tuples are then sorted before being written out to index file on HDFS.

     * @param serializedPhyPlan Serialized physical plan on right side.
