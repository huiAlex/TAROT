/**
 * A JSON Pig store function.  Each Pig tuple is stored on one line (as one
 * value for TextOutputFormat) so that it can be read easily using
 * TextInputFormat.  Pig tuples are mapped to JSON objects.  Pig bags are
 * mapped to JSON arrays.  Pig maps are also mapped to JSON objects.  Maps are
 * assumed to be string to string.  A schema is stored in a side file to deal
 * with mapping between JSON and Pig types. The schema file share the same format
 * as the one we use in PigStorage.
