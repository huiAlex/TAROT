/**
 * Generates the minimum of a set of values. This class implements
 * {@link org.apache.pig.Algebraic}, so if possible the execution will
 * performed in a distributed fashion.
 * 
 * MIN can operate on any numeric type and on chararrays.  It can also operate on bytearrays,
 * which it will cast to doubles.    It expects a bag of
 * tuples of one record each.  If Pig knows from the schema that this function
 * will be passed a bag of integers or longs, it will use a specially adapted version of
 * MIN that uses integer arithmetic for comparing the data.  The return type
 * of MIN will match the input type.
 * 
 * MIN implements the {@link org.apache.pig.Accumulator} interface as well.
 * While this will never be
 * the preferred method of usage it is available in case the combiner can not be
 * used for a given calculation.
