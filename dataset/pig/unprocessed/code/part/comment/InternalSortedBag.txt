/**

 * stored unsorted as it comes in, and only sorted when it is time to dump
 * it to a file or when the first iterator is requested.  Experementation
 * found this to be the faster than storing it sorted to begin with.
 * 
 * We allow a user defined comparator, but provide a default comparator in
 * cases where the user doesn't specify one.
 * 
 * This bag is not registered with SpillableMemoryManager. It calculates
 * the number of tuples to hold in memory and spill pro-actively into files.
