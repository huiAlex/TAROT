/**
 * ScriptStates encapsulates settings for a Pig script that runs on a hadoop
 * cluster. These settings are added to all MR jobs spawned by the script and
 * in turn are persisted in the hadoop job xml. With the properties already in
 * the job xml, users who want to know the relations between the script and MR
 * jobs can derive them from the job xmls.
