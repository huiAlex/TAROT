/**
 * Generates the count of the number of values in a bag.  This count does not
 * include null values, and thus matches SQL semantics for COUNT(a) (where a is
 * field) but not for COUNT(*) (where * in SQL indicates all).
 * 
 * This class
 * implements {@link org.apache.pig.Algebraic}, so if possible the execution will
 * performed in a distributed fashion.
 * 
 * There are no restrictions as to the data types inside the bag to be counted.
 * 
 * COUNT implements the {@link org.apache.pig.Accumulator} interface as well.
 * While this will never be
 * the preferred method of usage it is available in case the combiner can not be
 * used for a given calculation.
