 * The visitor class for the Physical Plan. To use this,

 * the visit() method to traverse the plan in a depth first
 * fashion.
 *
 * This class also visits the nested plans inside the operators.
 * One has to extend this class to modify the nature of each visit
 * and to maintain any relevant state information between the visits
 * to two different operators.
