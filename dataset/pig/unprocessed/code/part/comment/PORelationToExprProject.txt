/**
 * Implements a specialized form of POProject which is
 * used *ONLY* in the following case:
 * This project is Project(*) introduced after a relational operator
 * to supply a bag as output (as an expression). This project is either
 * providing the bag as input to a successor expression operator or is 
 * itself the leaf in a inner plan
 * If the predecessor relational operator sends an EOP
 * then send an empty bag first to signal "empty" output
 * and then send an EOP

 * NOTE: A Project(*) of return type BAG whose predecessor is
 * from an outside plan (i.e. not in the same inner plan as the project)
 * will NOT lead us here. So a query like:
 * a = load 'baginp.txt' as (b:bag{t:tuple()}); b = foreach a generate $0; dump b;
 * will go through a regular project (without the following flag)
