/**
 * This implementation is applicable for both the physical plan and for the
 * local backend, as the conversion of physical to mapreduce would see the SORT
 * operator and take necessary steps to convert it to a quantile and a sort job.
 *
 * This is a blocking operator. The sortedDataBag accumulates Tuples and sorts
 * them only when there an iterator is started. So all the tuples from the input
 * operator should be accumulated and filled into the dataBag. The attachInput
 * method is not applicable here.
