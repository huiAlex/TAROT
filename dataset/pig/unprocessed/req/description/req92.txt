This is an admin feature providing ability to blacklist or/and whitelist certain commands and operations. Pig exposes a few of these that could be not very safe in a multitenant environment. For example,  sh  invokes shell commands,  set  allows users to change non-final configs. While these are tremendously useful in general, having an ability to disable would make Pig a safer platform. The goal is to allow administrators to be able to have more control over user scripts. Default behaviour would still be the same - no filters applied on commands and operators.
