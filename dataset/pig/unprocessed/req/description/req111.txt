I m finding PigStorage() really convenient for storage and data interchange because it compresses well and imports into Excel and other analysis environments well.
However, it is a pain when it comes to maintenance because the columns are in fixed locations and I d like to add columns in some cases.
It would be great if load PigStorage() could read a default schema from a .schema file stored with the data and if store PigStorage() could store a .schema file with the data.
I have tested this out and both Hadoop HDFS and Pig in -exectype local mode will ignore a file called .schema in a directory of part files.
So, for example, if I have a chain of Pig scripts I execute such as:
A = load  data-1  using PigStorage() as ( a: int , b: int );
store A into  data-2  using PigStorage();
B = load  data-2  using PigStorage();
describe B;
describe B should output something like
{ a: int, b: int }
