Currently users can set the job name through Pig Latin by saying
set job.name  my job name
The ability to set the priority would also be nice, and the patch should be small.  The goal is to be able to say
set job.priority  high
and throw a JobCreationException in the JobControlCompiler if the priority is not one of the allowed string values from the o.a.h.mapred.JobPriority enum: very_low, low, normal, high, very_high.   Case insensitivity makes this a little nicer.
