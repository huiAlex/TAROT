When you are managing Avro Schemas in your source code and you have the Java classes to serialize/deserialize Avro, it would be easier to do something like:
store a into  tmp/myuser  using AvroStorage(null,  -schemaclass com.myco.MyUser )
Rather than passing as the first agurment, the entire Avro schema json in the pig script, or keeping a (potentially outdated) set of Avro schema files in HDFS for the -schemafile option.
If your classpath is already aware of how to serialize/deserialize the Avro data, it would be good to leverage that with a fully qualified classname.
