At Mortar we needed an easy way to store/parse a script s map reduce plan.  We added an xml output format for the MapReduce plan to make this easier.  We also added a flag to keep track of if each store or load was from the original script (and associated with an alias) or if its a temporary store/load generated by Pig.
