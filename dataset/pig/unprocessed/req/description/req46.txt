The attached patch proposes a javascript implementation for Pig embedding and UDFs in scripting languages.
It is similar to the Jython implementation and uses Rhino provided in the JDK.
some differences:
output schema is provided by: &lt;functionName&gt;.outSchema= &lt;schema&gt;  as javascript does not have annotations or decorators but functions are first class objects
tuples are converted to objects using the input schema (the other way around using the output schema)
The attached patch is not final yet. In particular it lacks unit tests.
See test/org/apache/pig/test/data/tc.js for the  transitive closure  example
