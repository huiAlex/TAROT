Pig does not handle deep cast from bag -&gt; bag, tuple -&gt; tuple. Eg, the following script does not produce desired result:
a = load  1.txt  as (a0:bag{t:tuple(i0: double )});
b = foreach a generate (bag{tuple( int )})a0;
dump b;
The result tuple still contain int inside tuple of bag.
fix the case we cast bytearray  &gt; bag/tuple, we take complex type including inner types, but bag &gt;bag, tuple-&gt;tuple is still not effective.
