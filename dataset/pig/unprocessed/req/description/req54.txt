A JsonLoader/JsonStorage implementation for Pig. This is based on Alan s implementation in the book ( ). I made some minor changes:
1. Drop the jackson feature requires 1.01+. Since Hadoop 203+ bundles jackson 1.01, newer feature fails when running on Hadoop 203+.
2. Using Json format for schema. This borrows Dmitry s schema implememtation in PigStorage.
3. Some bug fixes.
