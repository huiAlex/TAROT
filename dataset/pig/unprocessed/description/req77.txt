Sometimes I feel like swimming with ANTLRs. This particular feature isn t too hard to add... and supports syntax like this:
a = load  thing  as (x: int );
b = foreach @ generate x;
c = foreach @ generate x;
d = foreach @ generate x;
I have a patch, though I need to make sure it doesn t change anything (it shouldn t) and I need to add tests.
