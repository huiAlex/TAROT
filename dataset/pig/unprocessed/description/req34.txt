As a safety measure, it is sometimes useful to monitor UDFs as they execute. It is often preferable to return null or some other default value instead of timing out a runaway evaluation and killing a job. We have in the past seen complex regular expressions lead to job failures due to just half a dozen (out of millions) particularly obnoxious strings.
It would be great to give Pig users a lightweight way of enabling UDF monitoring.
