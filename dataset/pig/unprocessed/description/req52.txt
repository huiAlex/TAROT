The existing PIG merge join has the following limitations:
1. It assumes the right side of the table must be accessed sequentially - record by record.
2. It does not perform well against large, sparse tables.
The current implementation of the merge join introduced the interface IndexableLoadFunc.  This  LoadFunc
supports the ability to  seekNear  a given key (before reading the next record).
The merge join physical operator only calls  seekNear  for the first key in each split (effectively eliminating splits
where the first and subsequent keys will not be found).  Subsequent joins are found by reading sequentially through
the records on the right table looking for matches from the left table.
While this method works well for dense join tables - it performs poorly against large sparse tables or data sources that support
point lookups natively (HBase for example).
The proposed enhancement is to add a new join type -  merge-sparse  to PIG latin.  When specified in the PIG script, this join type
will cause the merge join operator to call seekNear on each and every key (rather than just the first in each split).
