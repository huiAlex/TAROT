Right now, the MapSideMergeValidator outright rejects any foreach that has a UDF in it:
private   boolean  isAcceptableForEachOp(Operator lo)  throws  LogicalToPhysicalTranslatorException {
if  (lo  instanceof  LOForEach) {
OperatorPlan innerPlan = ((LOForEach) lo).getInnerPlan();
validateMapSideMerge(innerPlan.getSinks(), innerPlan);
return  !containsUDFs((LOForEach) lo);
}  else  {
return   false ;
}
}
There is a TODO for this later on in that same class (inside containsUDFs):
// TODO (dvryaboy): in the  future  we could relax  this  rule by tracing what fields
// are being passed into the UDF, and only refusing  if  the UDF is working on the
// join key. Transforms of other fields should be ok.
We should do the TODO and relax this requirement or just remove it altogether
