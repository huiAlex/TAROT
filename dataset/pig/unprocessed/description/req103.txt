Lets say we have a string =  A1B2C3D4 . Our objective is to replace A with 1, B with 2, C with 3 and D with 4 to derive 11223344 string.
Using existing REPLACE method
REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE( A1B2C3D4 , A , 1 ), B , 2 ), C , 3 ), D , 4 )
With proposed UDF : REPLACE_MULTI method
General Syntax :
REPLACE_MULTI ( sourceString,   )
REPLACE_MULTI (  A1B2C3D4 ,   )
Advantage :
1. Function calls are reduced.
2. Ease to code and better readable.
Let me know your thoughts/ inputs on having this UDF in Piggy Bank. Will take this up based on this.
