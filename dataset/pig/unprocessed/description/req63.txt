This is a barebones patch for AvroStorage which enables support of multiple input schemas.  The assumption is that the input consists of avro files having different schemas that can be unioned, e.g., flat records.
A simple illustrative example is attached (avro_storage_union_schema_test.tar.gz): run create_avro1.pig, followed by create_avro2.pig, followed by read_avro.pig.
