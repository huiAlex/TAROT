Access Control: when processes try to read from the column groups, Zebra should be able to handle allowed vs. disallowed user/application accesses.  The security is eventuallt granted by corresponding  HDFS security of the data stored.
Expected behavior when column group permissions are set:
When user selects only columns that they do not have permissions to access, Zebra should return error with message  Error #: Permission denied for accessing column &lt;column name or names&gt;
Access control applies to an entire column group, so all columns in a column group have same permissions.
