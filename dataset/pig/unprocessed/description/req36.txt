When the data has schema, it often makes sense to union on column names in schema rather than the position of the columns.
The behavior of existing union operator should remain backward compatible .
This feature can be supported using either a new operator or extending union to support  using  clause . I am thinking of having a new operator called either unionschema or merge . Does anybody have any other suggestions for the syntax ?
example -
L1 = load  x  as (a,b);
L2 = load  y  as (b,c);
U = unionschema L1, L2;
describe U;
U:
{a:bytearray, b:byetarray, c:bytearray}
