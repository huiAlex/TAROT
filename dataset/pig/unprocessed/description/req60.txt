It would be convenient to be able to implement  PigProcessNotifcationListener  and to wire it into a pig script. This jira is to support setting a listener and its constructor args on the command, perhaps like this:
noformat
pig -j MyListener -J  foo,bar,bat  -f my_script.pig
noformat
where  MyListener  takes a single string in the constructor which will get passed  foo,bar,bat .
