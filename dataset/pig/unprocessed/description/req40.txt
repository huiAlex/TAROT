A common use case we see in Pig is people have many columns in their data and they only want to operate on a few of them.  Consider for example if before storing data with ten columns, the user wants to perform a cast on one column:
Z = foreach Y generate ( int )firstcol, secondcol, thridcol, forthcol, fifthcol, sixthcol, seventhcol, eigthcol, ninethcol, tenthcol;
store Z into  output ;
Obviously this only gets worse as the user has more columns.  Ideally the above could be transformed to something like:
Z = foreach Y generate ( int )firstcol,   and all the  rest   ;
store Z into  output
