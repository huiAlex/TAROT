I d like to compute the top 10 results in each group.
The natural way to express this in Pig would be:
A = load  ...  using PigStorage() as (
date:  int ,
count:  int ,
url: chararray
);
B = group A by ( date );
C = foreach B {
D = order A by count desc;
E = limit D 10;
generate
FLATTEN(E);
};
dump C;
Yeah, I could write a UDF / PiggyBank function to take the top n results. But since LIMIT already exists as a statement, it seems like it should also work in the nested foreach context.
Example workaround code.
C = foreach B {
D = order A by count desc;
E = util.TOP(D, 10);
generate
FLATTEN(E);
};
dump C;
