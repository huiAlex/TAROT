The  PigProgressNotificationListner  should get notified of the plan ( MROperPlan ) before it gets executed. This allows listeners to inspect the plan and have an idea what to expect in the execution flow. Proposal is to add the following method to the PPNL interface, which is marked as evolving:
public  void initialPlanNotification(MROperPlan plan);
