The @Immutable annotation has a list of known  effectively immutable  classes. There should be some way to provide an extensible list of class names or  vouch  for a particular field s immutability.
Possible ways to implement might look like the examples below:
@Immutable class Person {
String  name
@KnownImmutable MyUuid id
}
@KnownImmutables()
@Immutable class Person {
String  name
MyDate dob
MuUuid id
}
.
