When we develop AST transformations, it is often difficult to check that a particular transformation performs what is necessary. For example, we would like, in type checking, to verify that after the type checker has performed its work, a particular AST node contains metadata about the inferred type. Checking this currently requires compilation trickery which is not user-friendly. We propose to add an AST transformation which allows embedding tests. For example, we could test the  @Field  AST transformation this way:
import  groovy.transform.*
@ASTTest(value = {
def owner = node.declaringClass
assert  owner.fields.any { it.name ==  x  }
}
@Field  int  x
.
