It would be handy to have a sort method on a Map or Property that would sort by the name/key since this is something that is commonly done. A possible implementation for a Property class might look like this:
Properties.metaClass.sort = {
new TreeMap(delegate)
}
Example usage would be:
System.properties.sort() .
