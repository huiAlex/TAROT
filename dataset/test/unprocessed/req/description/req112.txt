The Groovy logging annotations (   ) currently only allow to change the name of the logger instance in the class, but they don t support to change the logging category.
The logging category seems to be hardcoded to be the fully qualified name of the annotated class, e.g.  foo.bar.MyClass . It would be nice have the possibility to change this category. Example:
package  foo.bar
@Commons(category =   some.custom.category.MyClass  )
class MyClass {
}
This would allow to specify custom categories which can then be used in the logging configuration to specify the level.
Especially in the Grails framework there are special components (services, controller) that use a custom logging category by default that prefixes the component, e.g.  grails.services.foo.bar.MyClass . Using the Groovy logging annotations breaks with convention and the logging configuration for these components effectively changes.  .
