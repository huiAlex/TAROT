John Wilson suggested this improved syntax for catching several exceptions at once:
This has been suggested for Java
I would have thought it s trivial to do in Groovy
try  {
Field field = someClass.getDeclaredField(someField);
someValue = field.getInt(Barcode.class);
}  catch  (SecurityException, NoSuchFieldException e) {
//  do  something  else  with the exception
}
.
