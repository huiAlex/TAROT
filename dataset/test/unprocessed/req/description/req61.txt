Ages ago i wrote a spell checker for groovy, that gives more helpful information in case a MissingMethodExeption or Missing Property Exception is thrown.
I recently picked it up and finished the patch.
It uses reflection to find missing methods with a low edit distance relative to the requested method. It also use the edit distance
as a method to rank the method so that the most probable solution is displayed first.
The performance impact is isolated to exception.getMessage for properties and Methods, but not for constructors.
I don t know of a case where this should impact a working program but it should be taken into consideration.
The unit tests are only partial(they era complete for the string/array metrics) but the other coverage is currently weak.
Missing method     ================================================================
groovy:000&gt; Integer.vallueOf( 10 )
ERROR groovy.lang.MissingMethodException: No signature of method: static java.lang.Integer.vallueOf() is applicable for argument types: (java.lang.String) values:  &#91;10&#93;
Possible solutions: valueOf(java.lang.String), valueOf(java.lang.String, int), valueOf(int)

Missing Constructor     ================================================================
new Integer(new Object())
ERROR groovy.lang.GroovyRuntimeException: Could not find matching constructor for: java.lang.Integer(java.lang.Object)
Possible solutions: java.lang.Integer(int), java.lang.Integer(java.lang.String)

Missing Constructor     ================================================================
new java.awt.Point().xy
