/** 
 * This is a slightly modified version of the Damerau Levenshtein distance algorithm. It has a additional test to see if a character has switched case, in the original algorithm this counts as a substitution. The "cost" for a substitution is given as 10 instead of 1 in this version, this enables transpositions and case modifications to have a lower cost than substitutions. Currently the lowercase versions of t_j and s_i isn't cached, its probable that some speed could be gained from this. This version is based on Chas Emerick's implementation of Levenshtein Distance for jakarta commons.

 * @param t the CharSequence to be compared to s
