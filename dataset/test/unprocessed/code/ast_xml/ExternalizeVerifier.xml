    <ClassComment>ExternalizeVerifier  /** 
 * Class annotation used to assist in the creation of  {@code Externalizable} classes.The  {@code @ExternalizeVerifier} annotation instructs the compiler to checkthat a class has  {@code writeExternal()} and {@code readExternal()} methods,implements the  {@code Externalizable} interface and that each property (and optionally field) is not finaland, optionally for non-primitives, has a type which is either  {@code Externalizable} or {@code Serializable}. Properties or fields marked as  {@code transient} are ignored.This annotation is typically used in conjunction with the  {@code @ExternalizeMethods} annotation butmost usually not directly but rather via  {@code @AutoExternalizable} which is a shortcut for both annotations.
