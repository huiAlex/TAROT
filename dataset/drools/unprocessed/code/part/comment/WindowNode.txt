/**
 * WindowNodes are nodes in the Rete network used

 * sliding windows, tumbling windows, etc.
 * 
 * This class must act as a lock-gate for all working memory actions on it
 * and propagated down the network in this branch, as there can be concurrent
 * threads propagating events and expiring events working on this node at the
 * same time. It requires it to be thread safe.
