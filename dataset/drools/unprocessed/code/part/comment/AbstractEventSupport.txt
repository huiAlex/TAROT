/**
 * Base class for Thread-safe Event Support in Drools. Note that subclasses wishing to access
 * the listeners should do so via the getEventListenersIterator method. This
 * will provide an Iterator accessing the current snapshot of the underlying list, freeing the
 * subclasss of thread problems.
 * 
 * Please note that for lists of small sizes, and few modifications, the CopyOnWriteArrayList
 * provides best performance. If the list is modified more often, than a simple ArrayList
 * with synchonized operations, and copying of the array for iteration is faster.
