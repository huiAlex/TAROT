I need to count the number of sub-objects that meet various criteria.  As an example, suppose I have several hundred Town objects, each of which has a list of perhaps a few hundred Person objects.  I need to write rules like:
Find all the towns that have more than three disabled people with incomes over $100K.
For each town with more than 1000 residents that has more than 50 poor children under the age of 8, add a teacher for every 25 children.
I m shaky on JBR syntax, but I think those would translate to something like:
rule  disabled
when
ArrayList(size &gt; 50) from collect( Person( disabled ==  yes , income &gt; 100000 ) from town.getPersons() )
then
//do stuff
end
rule  teachers
when
town : Town( population &gt; 1000 )
count : Arraylist from collect( Person( disabled ==  yes , income &gt; 100000 ) from town.getPersons() )
count( size &gt; 50 )
then
town.addTeachers(count.size() / 25)
end
(I m not really working with towns and people, but it makes for easily understood examples)
