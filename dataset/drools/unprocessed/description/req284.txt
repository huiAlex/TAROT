We need to support XML bindings for the Descr classes.
(starting with PackageDescr specifically).
XMLBeans or similar etc. The idea is to provide some XML support for those who need to use XML authoring, or generating tools, and also provide a  native  Drools XML format for use with XSLT for RuleML, OWL etc.... Should be 1 to 1 with the Descr AST classes mostly.
