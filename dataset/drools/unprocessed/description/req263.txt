Forward Chaining means that facts are asserted and propgated forward throughout the network, during forward propagation matching takes place which results in rules being fired - the rules are event based, in that they are fired in response to changed in the working memory.
Backward chaining is query based. Rules attempt to fire first but do not have the necessary matched facts, so facts are pulled in from an external source.
