Currently you cannot use relational operators for String fields. e.g. MyFact(name &gt;  bbb )
org.drools.base.evaluators.ComparableEvaluatorsDefinition.evaluators has entries for ValueType.OBJECT_TYPE, but not for ValueType.STRING_TYPE. So it results in DescrBuildError:
=========
Evaluator  &gt;  does not support type  ValueType =  String  :  &#91;Rule name=&#39;Your First Rule&#39;&#93;
Unable to create restriction   &#91;LiteralRestriction: &gt; bbb&#93;   for field  name  in the rule  Your First Rule  :  &#91;Rule name=&#39;Your First Rule&#39;&#93;
=========
According to docs:
4.8.3.1.1.3.1. Operators
Other relational operatory may be used whenever the type values are ordered;
It is desirable to allow relational operators for String fields as String is Comparable.
