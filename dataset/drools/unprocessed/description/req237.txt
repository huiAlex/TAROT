Two distinct sets of rules might share the need for a common declared type, usually an internal utility fact
The building process, however, forbids multiple declarations of the same fact in different DRLs.
The quickest solution, removing the declaration from one of the two, might not be feasible when the two files have to be deployed independently as well as together.
Externalizing the declarations to a third file might not always be feasible, especially when there is no full control on the DRLs (e.g. generated automatically or
acquired from external sources).
The builder, then, should recognize equivalent declarations to an existing one and simply ignore them.
