Prior to Java 8 it was possible to disable constraints jitting by setting the drools.permgenThreshold to 0. Since with Java 8 they removed the PermGen space, is no longer possible to control and disable constraints jitting.
It is required to provide a new option, named drools.jittingThreshold, through which it will be possible to configure after how many interpreted evaluations a constraint should be jitted. Special values for this property will be:
0 -&gt; force immediate synchronous jitting (it s adviced to use this only for testing purposes).
-1 (or any other negative number) -&gt; disable jitting
Default value is 20.
