Currently,  exists  conditional element is implemented as a sequence of 2  not  nodes. This is suboptimal for performance and adds complexity to the network with specialized constraints and the requirement for a specific RightInputAdapterNode.
Also, the currently implementation causes unnecessary work to be performed. For instance, trace the work done in the terminal node in the following example:
package org.drools
query  2 persons with the same status
p : Person($status : status, $age : age)
exists Person(status == $status, age &gt; $age);
end
So, replace current implementation for a specialized  ExistsNode .
