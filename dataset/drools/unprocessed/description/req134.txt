Currently there exists the method getWorkingMemoryEntryPoint(String) - that will return the named entry point.
There is not an API call exposed to allow the collection of entry points to be gathered. Such as  Collection&lt;WorkingMemoryEntryPoint&gt; getWorkingMemoryEntryPoints()
This would be useful in many ways to allow developers to maintain entry points and list those points for further use (IE a gui that tests rules by allowing the selection of which entry point an event enters)
Otherwise the developer is forced to hold and sync this information outside the drools code, which is both messy and prone to bugs and faults.
A typical way would be to hold a list of entry points at their creation and hope that no other code removes the entry point without updating the list.
Discussed with e tirelli on IRC.
