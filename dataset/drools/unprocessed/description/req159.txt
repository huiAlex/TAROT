Hello,
I am trying to determine, iterate the working memory streams within my rule by doing the following:
for(WorkingMemoryEntryPoint entry : session.getWorkingMemoryEntryPoints())
{
System.err.println( entry point stream:   + entry.toString());
}
But I can find no method/way to finid the actual text name of the entry point(what is written in the rule as from entry-point  xxxx ).
Is there a way to do this?  To list the readable names of the entry points from your session?  I would like to list those entry points in a drop down as application profiles, so if they have one selected, one entry point of rules will be inserted to and so on..
Thanks,
Chris
