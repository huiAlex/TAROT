Expose org.drools.runtime.rule StatefulRuleSession. fireAllRules(org.drools.runtime.rule. AgendaFilter agendaFilter, int fireLimit)
fireAllRules(AgendaFilter agendaFilter, int fireLimit) is exposed in org.drools. StatefulSession class. StatefulSession extends WorkingMemory which has the above API.
We look for the same function in org.drools.runtime.StatefulKnowledgeSession class.  StatefulKnowledgeSession extends org.drools.runtime.rule. StatefulRuleSession which doesn t have method fireAllRules(org.drools.runtime.rule. AgendaFilter agendaFilter, int fireLimit). We would like to have  the API added so we can switch from the rule base to the knowledge base.
