Java classes can be defined in DRL using the  declare  keyword.
It would be good to be able to define Java 1.5 enums using  declare  too.
We could then strip the proprietary  Guvnor style enums  from Guvnor and have the UI front DRL supported enums.
Guvnor currently also supports related\dependent enums where the  list of values  for one enum is dependent upon the value from another enum: enum FUEL has values  Petrol  and  Diesel , enum FUEL_DERIVATIVE has values  Unleaded ,  Super unleaded ,  Bio-diesel  and  City disel . If FUEL.Petrol is selected then only FUEL_DERIVATIVE values of  Unleaded  and  Super unleaded  can be chosen. This functionality would still need to be provided by Guvnor as it is used as  author-time  restrictions not runtime.
