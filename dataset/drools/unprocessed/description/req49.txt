when a rule uses a java class in a pattern:
package my.test;
import org.drools.Cheese;
rule R when Cheese() then end
a TypeDeclaration for that class (e.g.Cheese) is created, but is assigned
to the rule package ( my.test ) rather than to the natural class package
( org.drools ). This prevents an efficient later lookup of the typeDeclaration
using the class name as a key.
