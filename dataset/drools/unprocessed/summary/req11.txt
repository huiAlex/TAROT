Support to Expression and Nested Accessors
Would be nice to have a feature like:
Map(this.foo == bar)  as being accessed as: map.get( foo )
This can work as in the ClassFieldInspector it can tell that there is no  getFoo  method, but there is a get(xxx) method - hence it can pass in the key as the field name (as a string).
A limitation may be that we want to use a prev bound variable as a key, but I can t see how that will work short of adding new syntax (this currently stays within the current grammar which is good - and looking up fields via a String key is more then useful !).
