org.drools.runtime.rule StatefulRuleSession.fireAllRules(org.drools.runtime.rule.AgendaFilter af) has no AgendaFilter implementations  
StatefulSession.fireAllRules(org.drools.spi.AgendaFilter af) has several implementations of AgendaFilter for filtering rules. Why aren t the AgendaFilters common? Even the Activation class between them is different, so it is not simple to workaround by wrapping org.drools.spi.AgendaFilter impls. It would be handy if there were out-of-the-box AgendaFilters for implementations of StatefulRuleSession.
