I ve got a use-case where I, at runtime, want to inspect the rule-attributes of our rules (e.g. salience, ruleflow-group, etc.) via the Drools API. Currently, the only way to retrieve that kind of information is via the internal Drools API, ie. org.drools.core.definitions.rule.impl.RuleImpl.
It would be nice if we could expose these rule attributes via a public API.
