It would be good the possibility to add (a optional)  name  and  description  to each Resource in change-set.  These attribute should be exposed by org.drools.io.Resource  The attributes are not going to be exposed through knowledge-api yet. They are going to be implemented in org.drools.io.internal.InternalResource
Even if these attributes don t have any effect in Resource s behavior and functionality, they will server as documentation of the change-set.
