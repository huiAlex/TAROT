I d like to be able to write a constraint to determine if a field s value is a member of some collection.  This is the inverse of the  contains  keyword.  The proposed syntax is:
&#91;bindingVar :&#93;  &lt;fieldName&gt; in &lt;someCollection&gt;
(I m not picky about the keyword, other possibilities are  containedBy  or  memberOf , but  in  is a single word)
Use case:
I have a container class with a field that exposes a collection of record
numbers.  In the working memory, I have a bunch of record objects, and one
container object.  I want to write a rule that fires when it encounters a
container that has records matching some criteria:
when
Container( $recordNums : records )
Record( number in $recordNums, otherField ==  somevalue  )
then
doStuff();
The current workaround is:
Record( num : number -&gt; ( $recordNums.contains(num) )  )
Which is problematic, as the predicate may not be time-constant.
