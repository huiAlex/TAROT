We know the method name for each descr. If we move the params all onto  a  single line we can use indexof to fine the start of each descr  compiled  code. We can then use that  to find the offiset and map the error  to the descr.
This is complex as the error handling needs to be reworked. CompilationProblem objects should NOT be stuffed inside rule errors, but be seperate rule errors (hence can have multiple line errors).
