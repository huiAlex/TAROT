I have a method such as:
/*
determines if any of the events passed as parameter has occurred
*/
public boolean hasAnyEventOccurred(String... events) {
for (String s : events) {
if (hasEventOccurred(s))
{
return true;
}
}
return false;
}
However in rules I can t call it like that:
hasAnyEventOccurred( event1 ,  event2 ,  event3 ), I have to workaround as so: hasAnyEventOccurred(new String
{ event1 ,  event2 ,  event3 }
)
