We can link the VerifierComponent with their descriptions.
This provides a simple access to information from the descriptions of the component or its associated VerifierMessageBase.
I tested this by adding to the VerifierComponent  constructor the BaseDescr :
public abstract class VerifierComponent implements Comparable&lt;VerifierComponent&gt;, Cause {
private BaseDescr descr;
public VerifierComponent(BaseDescr descr)
{
this.descr = descr;
}
}
And integrate that in all Visitors.
This seems to work. (   )
What do you think of this, I can add test cases and provide a patch or git pull request.
