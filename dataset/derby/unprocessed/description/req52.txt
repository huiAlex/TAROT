Support use of the WHEN clause in CREATE TRIGGER statements. The clause is described in the SQL standard (2003) in chapter  11.39 &lt;trigger definition&gt;  under  &lt;triggered action&gt; .
There are traces in the code that suggests some work has been done on this earlier. If anyone knows something about this, please add a comment to this issue.
