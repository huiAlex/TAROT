If Network Client cannot connect to the database to retrieve an error message, it will print only the message tokens, the non-ascii token separators, and derby log location.  It would be good if at least the message could be formatted to present a better message to the user without the non-ascii characters.
To reproduce try a database shutdown.  Because the database is shutdown, the client cannot retrieve the actual message from the server. It therefore just prints the tokens.
Start network server
java org.apache.derby.drda.NetworkServerControl start
$ java org.apache.derby.tools.ij
ij version 10.1
ij&gt; connect  jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/wombat;create=true ;
ij&gt; connect  jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/wombat;shutdown=true ;
ERROR 08006: DERBY SQL error: SQLCODE: -1, SQLSTATE: 08006, SQLERRMC: wombat08006.DDatabase  wombat  shutdown.(server log:derby.log)
ij&gt;
Note: The actual offending characters have been replaced in the output in this bug by . This is because they break Jira XML retrieval!
