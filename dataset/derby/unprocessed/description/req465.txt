DataDictionaryImpl and CreateTriggerNode contain implementations of bubble sort that could be replaced by calls to Collections.sort(). This isn t performance critical code (it s only used for sorting vectors of column references or table nodes at compile time) so there shouldn t be much to gain by hand-coding the sorting. Using Collections.sort() has the benefits that it results in less code and that the implementation has probably gone through more testing than our hand-coded one.
