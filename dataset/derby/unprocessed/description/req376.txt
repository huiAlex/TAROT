After the change for   the  connection toString() output is  an integer which correspond to SESSIONID.  The output should identify the type and also the meaning of the identifier that it prints.  Perhaps a format that appends the default toString output with the sessionid information as it prints in the derby.log would be more informative.
org.apache.derby.impl.jdbc.EmbedConnection@efd552 (SESSONID = 2)
Ultimately this could be expanded to included other diagnostic information e.g
org.apache.derby.impl.jdbc.EmbedConnection@efd552 (XID = 132), (SESSIONID = 5), (DATABASE = wombat), (DRDAID = NF000001.H324-940125304405039114
{7}
)
