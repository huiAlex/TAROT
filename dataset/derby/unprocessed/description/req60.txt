If I repeatedly insert into a clob table and rollback the the transaction the space is not reclaimed and the number of allocated pages continues to grow.   I will add a test case to ClobReclamationTest and reference this bug.
may be a special case of this bug, but I thought I would file a bug for the general issue.
