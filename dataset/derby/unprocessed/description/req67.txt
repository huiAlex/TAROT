In reviewing the Network Server Code and profiling there were
several areas that showed potential for providing performance
improvement.
Functions that need optimizing to prevent unneeded object
creation and excessive decoding
parsePKGNAMCSN()
parseSQLDTA_work()
buildDB2CursorName()
In DDMWriter and DDMReader, use System Routines in
java.util.Arrays and System.arrayCopy instead of
writing code to do functions like copy arrays and
pad strings.
