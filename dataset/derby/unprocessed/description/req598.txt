Since JDK 7, when we use the standard decorator for JUnit tests, e.g.
return TestConfiguration.defaultSuite(AggBuiltinTest.class);
the order in which the test fixtures get run is indeterministic. This is undesirable because it doesn t add much coverage to the product and makes the tests more brittle than they need to be.
