Right now there are 2 optimizer implementations, only one of which is ever loaded. The other implementation was disabled by the following comment in modules.properties:
use level1 optimizer for small configurations
#
can t do this in the codeline because with 2 implementations, it is entirely
by chance which get picked.  So we may be running with different modules
depending on which jdk
#
to be resolve by Siuling and Dan
#
#derby.module.optimizerSmall=org.apache.derby.impl.sql.compile.OptimizerFactoryImpl
#cloudscape.config.optimizerSmall=cloud,cloudtarget
Since we have deprecated support for the small CDC configuration, I don t think that we need further resolution by Siuling and Dan. Collapsing the two optimizers together should slightly reduce our static footprint.
