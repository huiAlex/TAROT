Change the internal implemetation of SYSCS_INPLACE_COMPRESS_TABLE to share existing alter table
code. One suggested approach is to use the same mechanism as SYSCS_COMPRESS_TABLE. Such
an implementation would involve:
o change the parser for alter table to accecpt some internal only syntax for SYSCS_INPLACE_COMPRESS_TABLE
o change the alter table constant action to get the required information for inplace compress
o move most of the inplace compress driving code to a routine in alter table execution, following the same
coding pattern as existing alter table compress.
I believe doing this will have multiple benefits:
1) shares existing alter table code, so things like error checking, security management, ... is all done by one piece of code
2) by sharing the code I believe the following outstanding JIRA issues will be addressed:  ,   -
3) future changes addressing ddl like grant/revoke will automatically work.
