Derby doesn t support the entire range of valid (finite) values of the Java primitive types double/float in columns with SQL type DOUBLE or REAL. This appears to be a limitation that was introduced for compatibility with DB2. There have been some requests on derby-user that we lift this restriction.
The restriction is enforced by the methods normalizeREAL() and normalizeDOUBLE() in org.apache.derby.iapi.types.NumberDataType.
