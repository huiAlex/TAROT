With the additional system permissions proposed in   I wonder if it makes sense to change the style of names &amp; actions in SystemPermission.
Today a  shutdown  name is proposed and potential for future  shutdownEngine  and  shutdownServer  with no actions.
is proposing names of jmxControl, serverControl, engineControl etc also with no actions.
Looking at the standard Permission class it seems the name is meant to represent an object that the permission applies to and action represent actions on that object.
Thus it would seem to make more sense and be consistent with other Permissions to have:
name=server action=control | monitor | shutdown
name=engine action=control | monitor | shutdown
name=jmx action=control
