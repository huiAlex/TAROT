You currently can t use a correlation ID in an UPDATE/DELETE statement. This makes it cumbersome to do the following:
UPDATE EMPLOYEE_BONUS
SET BONUS = (SELECT SUM(BONUSES.BONUS) FROM BONUSES WHERE
EMPLOYEE_BONUS.EMPL_ID = BONUSES.EMPL_ID);
The use of a correlation ID makes this easier to code.
UPDATE EMPLOYEE E
SET BONUS = (SELECT SUM(B.BONUS) FROM BONUSES B WHERE B.EMPL_ID = E.EMPL_ID);
This is particularly important if you get carried away with long SCHEMA and TABLE names!
