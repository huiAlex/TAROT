Since the functions added in   overlap with the numeric scaler functions defined in section C.1 of JDBC 3.0 it would be benfiical to expand the table to indicate if the function can be used as a JDBC escaped scaler as well.
Plus adding all the code to find them and call them etc.
I ll add a comment later to show which JDBC escape functions this would add.
