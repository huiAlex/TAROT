If a database is created with logDevice pointing to a directory
containing old log files, one might experience errors during recovery.
ERROR XSDB4: Page Page(0,Container(0, 768)) is at version 2,657, the
log file contains change version 2,715, either there are log records
of this page missing, or this page did not get written out to disk
properly.
To avoid this problem, database creation should fail if logDevice is
pointing to an existing directory.
