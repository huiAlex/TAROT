When looking at a test coverage report, I noticed that these methods in the SQLBoolean class are not tested:
falseTruthValue
trueTruthValue
greaterOrEquals
greaterThan
lessOrEquals
lessThan
is
isNot
readExternal
hashCode
falseTruthValue() and trueTruthValue() are never called anywhere in the code and could be removed.
is() and isNot() also have no callers. However, they implement the boolean IS operator which is part of the SQL standard, so it might make more sense to file a JIRA to add the syntax to the grammar rather than removing the methods.
