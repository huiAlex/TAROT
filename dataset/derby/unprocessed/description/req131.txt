Currently  the client tracing can be enabled by  setting attributes on the client url, setXXX methods on the DataSource or calling DriverManager.setLogWriter(), but it often cannot be enabled in a deployed client application  because all of these API s require modification of the application or its configuration files.
It would be good to have a global way to turn on client tracing.  A system property pointing to a property file is  one possibility but probably not ideal because of the impact in class loader contexts.    I am not sure what the other possiblities are,
