Handle interrupt received while waiting for database lock  
Subtask of  : this issue tracks the changes needed to handle interrupt received while a thread is waiting for a database lock.
Let query stop execution if an interrupt is seen, at same time as we check the query timeout
Subtask of  .
In BasicNoPutResultSetImpl#checkCancellationFlag we currently check whether a statement has been canceled or it timed out at certain times during query execution. We would like an interrupt seen during execution hitherto to also throw at this point. Cf the way we also stop execution of batches if a batch element sees an interrupt.
