The SYSCS_IMPORT_TABLE (and SYSCS_IMPORT_DATA) function allow import of data from external resources. In general, they can process CSV files that created with various tools - with one exception: the header line.
While there is no accepted standard, most tools will include a header line in the CSV file with column names. This convention is supported in Excel and many other tools.
My Request: extend the SYSCS_IMPORT_TABLe and SYSCS_IMPORT_DATA (and other related procedures) to include an extra indicator for the number of header lines to be ignored.
As an extra bonus it will be help is the SYSCS_IMPORT_DATA will accept column names (instead of column indexes) in the  COLUMNINDEXES  arguments. E.g., it should be possible to indicate COLUMNINDEXES of  1,3,sales,5, . This feature will make it significantly easier to handle cases where the external input files is extended to include additional columns.
