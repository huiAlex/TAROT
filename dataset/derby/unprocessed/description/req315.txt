Jdk 1.5 introduced Thread.getAllStackTraces() which can be used to print a thread dump programatically.  The test stress.multi kills off its testers if it reaches a deadlock or the testers can t complete on their own. It would be helpful in this case to get a thread dump automatically.  The code could only be enabled for jdk 1.5 and higher.
