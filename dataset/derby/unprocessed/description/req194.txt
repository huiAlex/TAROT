Since this is compilinga statement returning the specific node makes more sense and will lead to a little more clarity in the code.
Some of the methods defined on QueryTreeNode such as generate() and needsSavepoint() can move down to StatementNode and thus make the code more readable ( which generate is called for a value node? ) and remove implementations of these methods that can never be called.
