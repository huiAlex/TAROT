As part of researching  , I came to the conclusion that
the trim() method in SQLChar.java is no longer used, and could be
removed. It appears that all calls to this method have been switched
to call ansiTrim() instead.
Hopefully, this just requires removing the code from SQLChar.java
and StringDataValue.java, and running all the tests to verify that
nothing is broken.
