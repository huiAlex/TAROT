If you run the VerifySignatures test, you will see a lot of JDBC4 methods which don t appear in our implementation yet. We need to add vacuous implementations for these methods which raise SQLFeatureNotSupportedExceptions. Most of these methods won t need any more attention because they refer to features (like xml and national strings) which we don t support. We will open additional JIRAs for the methods which need non-vacuous implementations.
