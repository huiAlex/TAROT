In this thread on derby-dev,  ,
it was mentioned that RAFContainer4 calls padFile() when creating a container. Since padFile() uses old I/O calls and the rest of RAFContainer4 uses NIO, it could possibly cause similar issues as those seen in  . Although we haven t verified that this is a problem, we should try to avoid mixing old I/O and NIO to be on the safe side.
