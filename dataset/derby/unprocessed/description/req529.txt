Change all the network server code under java/drda to use spaces instead of tabs.
Having mixed tabs and spaces can be confusing, irritating  and time consuming for developers especially in the network code where client is all spaces and the server mostly tabs.
With the  -x -b options on svn merge and svn diff, merges should be reasonable even if we change all the tabs to 4 spaces in the files under java/drda with a script something like (not yet tried):
#!/bin/bash
files=$@
for file in $files
{
echo $file
mv  $file $file.orig
sed -e  s/\t/    /g  &lt; $file.orig &gt; $file
rm $file.orig
}
Are there any objections to this change?  If not does anyone have any pending DRDA changes they would like to get in before I make the change?
