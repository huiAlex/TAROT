Derby currently doesn t allow CALL statement to be used in a trigger body. It would be great to allow java stored procedure invocation inside a trigger. Since Derby doesn t have SQL procedure language, triggers can only execute a single SQL statement. If we allow stored procedures in triggers, it would be possible to write a trigger that involves more than just one SQL statement. Functions are currently allowed, but they are read-only.
I believe it is fairly easy to support this enhancement. Need good amount of testing though.
