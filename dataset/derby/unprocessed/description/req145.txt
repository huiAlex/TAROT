The heavy use of static state information in the existing Derby (non-Junit) harness was a major mistake, it should not be repeated in the Junit model.
It should be changed before too many tests are written.
A static configuration will limit the ability for the tests to be flexible and have different instances running with different configurations,
a instance based scheme will be more flexible.
This change will just change the api, the current implementation of  a single static configuration will remain but be hidden within the base-classes.
