Make client driver treat BOOLEAN columns the same way as the embedded driver does.  
The only operation currently allowed on BOOLEAN columns is to select them from the system tables. For instance, the following query selects BOOLEAN values:
select systemalias from sys.sysaliases;
There are discrepancies in how the embedded and client drivers handle these BOOLEAN columns. The embedded behavior is correct and the client behavior should conform. I will attach a spec describing what needs to be done.
Allow functions to return BOOLEAN values 
As part of our expanding support for the BOOLEAN datatype, it would be nice to allow functions to return BOOLEAN values. 
Allow explicit casts of string values to BOOLEAN  
The SQL Standard allows strings to be explicitly cast to BOOLEAN values. Strings are the only type (other than BOOLEAN itself) which can be cast to BOOLEAN. As part of our expanding support for the BOOLEAN datatype, we should allow these casts.
Casting string types to boolean is defined by part 2, section 6.12 (&lt;cast specification&gt;), general rule 20:
a) Trim whitespace off the string
b) Then apply the rules in section 5.3 (&lt;literal&gt;). This means that the trimmed string must be  TRUE ,  FALSE , or  UNKNOWN , regardless of case.
c) Otherwise, raise an exception.
Allow routines to take arguments of BOOLEAN type  
We should allow routines to take BOOLEAN arguments as part of our expanding support for the BOOLEAN datatype.
Make it possible for table functions to return BOOLEAN columns  
Right now a function cannot return a table with a BOOLEAN column.
Enable BOOLEAN typed columns
Allow tables to have boolean columns.
