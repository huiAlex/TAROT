provided a manual way to update the statisitcs. There was some discussion in that jira entry for possibly optimizing the cases where there is no need to update the statistics. I will enter the related comments from that jira entry here for reference.

If I have understood correctly, unique indexes always have up to date cardinality statistics because cardinality == row count. If that s the case, one possible optimization is to skip the unique indexes when SYSCS_UPDATE_STATISTICS is called.

is the cardinality of a unique index 1 or is it row count?
It is also more complicated than just skipping unique indexes, it depends on the number of columns in the index because
in a multi-column index, multiple cardinalities are calculated. So for instance on an index on columns A,B,C there are
actually 3 cardinalities calculated:
A
A,B
A,B,C
I agree that the calculation of cardinality of A,B,C could/should be short circuited for a unique index.

Mike,
It looks to me as if the cardinality is the number of unique values, so I think the cardinality of a unique index is equal to its row count (for the full key, that is). You re right that we can t short circuit it if we have a multi-column index. I don t know if it s worth the extra complexity to short circuit the A,B,C case, since we d have to scan the entire index anyway. For a single-column unique index it sounds like a good idea, though.
