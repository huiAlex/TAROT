/**

/**
    Close the conglomerate controller.
	
	Any changes to this method will probably have to be reflected in close as 
    well.
	
	Currently delegates to OpenBTree.  If the btree controller ends up not 
    having any state of its own, we can remove this method (the VM will 
    dispatch to OpenBTree), gaining some small efficiency.  For now, this 
    method remains for clarity.
