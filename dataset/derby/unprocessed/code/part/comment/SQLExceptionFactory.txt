     * The following method helps handle DERBY-1178. The problem is that we may
     * need to serialize our final SQLException across the DRDA network layer.
     * That serialization involves some clever encoding of the Derby messageID and
     * arguments. Unfortunately, once we create one of the
     * JDBC4-specific subclasses of SQLException, we lose the messageID and
     * args. This method creates a dummy StandardException which preserves that
     * information, unless the cause is already a StandardException which
     * contains the necessary information for serializing the exception.
