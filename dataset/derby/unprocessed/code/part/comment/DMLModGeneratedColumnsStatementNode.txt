 * A DMLModGeneratedColumnsStatementNode for a table(with identity columns)
 *  modification: to wit, INSERT, UPDATE.
 * The code below used to reside in InsertNode but when we fixed DERBY-6414,
 *  rather than duplicating the code in UpdateNode, we moved the common code 
 *  for insert and update of identity columns to this class.
