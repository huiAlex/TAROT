     * Construct a StorageRandomAccessFileImpl.
     *
     * @param name The file name.
     * @param mode The file open mode: "r", "rw", "rws", or "rwd". The  "rws" and "rwd" modes specify that the file is to
     *             be synchronized, consistent with the java.io.RandomAccessFile class. However the
     *             StorageRandomAccessFile.sync() method will be called even if the file was opened
     *             in "rws" or "rwd" mode.  If the "rws" or "rwd" modes are supported then the implementation
     *             of StorageRandomAccessFile.sync need not do anything.
     *
     * @exception IllegalArgumentException if the mode argument is not equal to one of "r", "rw".
     * @exception FileNotFoundException if the file exists but is a directory rather than a regular
     *              file, or cannot be opened or created for any other reason .
