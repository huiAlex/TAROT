/**

  The "B2I" (acronym for b-tree secondary index) factory manages b-tree
  conglomerates implemented	on the raw store which are used as secondary
  indexes.
  
  Most of this code is generic to all conglomerates.  This class might be
  more easily maintained as an abstract class in Raw/Conglomerate/Generic.
  The concrete ConglomerateFactories would simply have to supply the 
  IMPLEMENTATIONID, FORMATUUIDSTRING, and implement createConglomerate
  and defaultProperties.  Conglomerates which support more than one format
  would have to override supportsFormat, and conglomerates which support
  more than one implementation would have to override supportsImplementation.

     * Return the Conglomerate Object.  This is implementation specific.
     * Examples of what will be done is using the id to find the file where
     * the conglomerate is located, and then executing implementation specific
     * code to instantiate an object from reading a "special" row from a
     * known location in the file.  In the btree case the btree conglomerate
     * is stored as a column in the control row on the root page.
     * 
     * This operation is costly so it is likely an implementation using this
     * will cache the conglomerate row in memory so that subsequent accesses
     * need not perform this operation.
     * 
     * The btree object returned by this routine may be installed in a cache
     * so the object must not change.
