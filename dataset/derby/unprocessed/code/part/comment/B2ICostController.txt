/**
 * Controller used to provide cost estimates to optimizer about secondary index
 * data access.
 *
 * Implements the StoreCostController interface for the B-Tree index
 * implementation.  The primary use of this interface is to provide costs
 * used by the query optimizer to use when choosing query plans. Provides
 * costs of things like fetch one row, how many rows in conglomerate, how
 * many rows between these 2 keys.
 *
 * Note most work of this class is inherited from the generic btree 
 * implementation.  This class initializes the top level object and deals with 
 * locking information specific to a secondary index implementation of a btree.
