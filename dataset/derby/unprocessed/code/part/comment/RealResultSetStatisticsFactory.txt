/**
 * ResultSetStatisticsFactory provides a wrapper around all of
 * objects associated with run time statistics.
 * 
 * This implementation of the protocol is for returning the "real"
 * run time statistics.  We have modularized this so that we could
 * have an implementation that just returns null for each of the
 * objects should we decided to provide a configuration without
 * the run time statistics feature.
