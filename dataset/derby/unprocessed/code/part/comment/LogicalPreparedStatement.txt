/**
 * A wrapper class for a physical Derby prepared statement.

 * The idea behind the logical prepared statement is to allow reuse of the
 * physical prepared statement. In general the logical entity will forward all
 * calls to the physical entity. A few methods have special implementations, the
 * most important one being {@link #close}. Each method will check that the
 * logical statement is still open before the call is forwarded to the
 * underlying physical statement.
