/**

The btree secondary index implementation of ScanManager which provides reading 
and deleting of entries in the btree secondary index.  

This supports setting up and
iterating through a set of rows while providing a start key, stop key,
and a set of AND and OR qualifiers to skip unwanted rows.  Currently
derby only supports forward scans (but individual columns can have
descending order).  This interface is also used to delete rows from
the conglomerate.  Note that update is not supported, it must be
implemented as a delete, followed by an insert.

Note most work of this class is inherited from the generic btree implementation.
This class initializes the top level object and deals with locking information
specific to a secondary index implementation of a btree.

    The btree init opens the container (super.init), and stores away the
    state of the qualifiers.  The actual searching for the first position
    is delayed until the first next() call.
