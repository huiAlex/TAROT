/**
 * The org.apache.derby.iapi.db.Database
 * interface provides "internal" methods on the database which are
 * not available to JBMS users (org.apache.derby.database.Database,
 * which this interface extends, provides all the externally visible
 * methods).
 * 
 * At the present moment, this file defines methods which will at
 * some point be moved to to the external database interface.
 *
 *  There are a bunch of the unimplemninted interface that used to be in
 * this file.  They have been moved to old_Database.java.  old_Database.java is
 * checked into the codeline but is not built, it is there for reference 
 *
