/**
 * The DataDictionary interface is used with the data dictionary to get
 * descriptors for binding and compilation. Some descriptors (such as table
 * and column descriptors) are added to and deleted from the data dictionary
 * by other modules (like the object store). Other descriptors are added and
 * deleted by the language module itself (e.g. the language module adds and
 * deletes views, because views are too high-level for modules like the object
 * store to know about).
