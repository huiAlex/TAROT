/**
 * Factory for creating a SYSALIASES row.

 * Here are the directions for adding a new system supplied alias.
 * Misc:
 *  All system supplied aliases are class aliases at this point.
 *	Additional arrays will need to be added if we supply system
 *	aliases of other types.
 *	The preloadAliasIDs array is an array of hard coded UUIDs
 *	for the system supplied aliases.
 *	The preloadAliases array is the array of aliases
 *	for the system supplied aliases.  This array is in alphabetical
 *	order by package and class in Xena.  Each alias is the uppercase
 *	class name of the alias.
 *  The preloadJavaClassNames array is the array of full package.class
 *  names for the system supplied aliases.  This array is in alphabetical
 *	order by package and class in Xena.  
 *	SYSALIASES_NUM_BOOT_ROWS is the number of boot rows in sys.sysaliases
 *  in a new database.
