/**
     * errorCodePoint specifies the code point of the error reply message, (e.g.
     * CodePoint.SYNTAXRM) whereas errCdCodePoint specifies the code point of an
     * extra required field in that reply message. Most error reply messages
     * have one or two required fields that are quite common, like SVRCOD
     * (severity code) or RDBNAM (database name). Some error reply messages
     * additionally have required fields that are specific to them.
     * errCdCodePoint is used to specify these. For instance, SYNTAXRM has a
     * required field called SYNERRCD, and PRCCNVRM has a required field called
     * PRCCNVCD.
