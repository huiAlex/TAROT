/**
 *
 * The Basic Services provide InfoStreams for reporting
 * information. Two streams are provided: trace and error.
 * It is configurable where these streams are directed.
 * 
 * Errors will be printed to the error stream in addition
 * to being sent to the client.
 * 
 * By default both streams are sent to an error log
 * for the system. When creating a message for a stream,
 * you can create an initial entry with header information
 * and then append to it as many times as desired.
 * 
 * Note: if character encodings are needed, the use of
 * java.io.*OutputStream's should be replaced with
 * java.io.*Writer's (assuming the Writer interface
 * remains stable in JDK1.1)
