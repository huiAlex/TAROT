/**
 * A ResultSetMetaData object can be used to find out about the types
 * and properties of the columns in a ResultSet.
 *
 * 
 * We take the (Derby) ResultDescription and examine it, to return
 * the appropriate information.

   
   This class can be used outside of this package to convert a
   ResultDescription into a ResultSetMetaData object.
   
   EmbedResultSetMetaData objects are shared across multiple threads
   by being stored in the ResultDescription for a compiled plan.
   If the required api for ResultSetMetaData ever changes so
   that it has a close() method, a getConnection() method or
   any other Connection or ResultSet specific method then
   this sharing must be removed.
