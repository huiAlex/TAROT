/**
        Registration of TypedFormat classes.

        
        A TypedFormat is registered by placing a class name at the
        correct place in the correct array, driven by the base format number:
        
        2 byte - MIN_TWO_BYTE_FORMAT_ID - TwoByte
        
        The offset from the base format number (0 based) gives the offset in the array.
        
        The class name is either:
        
         The actual class name of the TypeFormat.
         The name of a class that extends org.apache.derby.iapi.services.io.FormatableInstanceGetter.
             In this case the monitor will register an instance of the class after calling its
                 setFormatId() method with format id it is registered as.

/** Return the number of two-byte format ids */

/** Return the class name bound to an index into TwoByte */
