/**
	A locking policy that implements row level locking with repeatable read
    isolation.  Since phantom protection with previous key locking is actually 
    handled by the upper level access methods, the only difference in repeatable
    read is that read locks are of type RowLock.RS2.  This type will not 
    conflict with a previous key insert lock.

/**
     * Unlock a record after it has been locked for read.
     * 
     * In repeatable read only unlock records which "did not qualify".  For
     * example in a query like "select * from foo where a = 1" on a table
     * with no index it is only necessary to hold locks on rows where a=1, but
     * in the process of finding those rows the system will get locks on other
     * rows to verify they are committed before applying the qualifier.  Those
     * locks can be released under repeatable read isolation.
