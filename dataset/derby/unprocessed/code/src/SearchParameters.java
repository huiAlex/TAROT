    Value to return in comparisons where partial key matches exactly 
    the partial key of a row.  Use this parameter to control where 
    in a duplicate partial key list to position the search.  

    Here are some examples:

    Assume: dataset of {1,0}, {5,1}, {5,2}, {6,4}; and partial key of {5}.


    If the scan is GE , then the scan intially wants to position
    on {1,0} (one before first qualifying row) - In this case when a partial
    match is found we want to return 1 when we hit {5,1}; but if the
    searchOperator is GT, then we want to return -1 on {5,1}, {5,2}, and then
    return 1 on {6,4}.


    partial_key_match_op =  POSITION_LEFT_OF_PARTIAL_KEY_MATCH: 
    Scan is looking for GE the partial key, so position the scan to the
    left of any partial key that exactly matches the partial key.
    If the scan is GE , then the scan intially wants to position
    on {1,0} (one before first qualifying row) - In this case when a partial
    match is found we want to return 1 when we hit {5,1}.

    partial_key_match_op = POSITION_RIGHT_OF_PARTIAL_KEY_MATCH: 
    Scan is looking for GT the partial key, so position the scan to the
    right of any partial key that exactly matches the partial key.
    If the scan is GT, then the scan intially wants to position
    on {5,2} (one before first qualifying row) - In this case when a partial
    match is found we want to return -1 when we hit on {5,1}, {5,2}, and then
    return 1 on {6,4}.

    partial_key_match_op =  0:

    to (not used currently).
