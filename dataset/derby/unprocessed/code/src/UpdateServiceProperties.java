	in which the database was created.
	While the database is being created, serviceBooted would be false. What that means
	is, don't save changes into services.properties file from here until the database
	is created. Instead, let BaseMonitor save the properties at the end of the database
  creation and also set serviceBooted to true at that point. From then on, the
  services.properties file updates will be made here.
