	/**
     * Calculate the cost of a sort.
     * <p>
     * The cost of a sort includes the time spent in the sorter inserting
     * the rows into the sort, and the time spent in the sorter returning the
     * rows.  Note that it does not include the cost of scanning the rows from
     * the source table, for insert into the sort.
     * <p>
     * Arguments to getSortCost(), should be the same as those to be passed to
     * TransactionController.createSort().
     *
     * @param template        A row which is prototypical for the sort.  All
     *                        rows inserted into the sort controller must have 
	 *                        exactly the same number of columns as the 
     *                        template row.  Every column in an inserted row
     *                        must have the same type as the corresponding
     *                        column in the template.
     *
     * @param columnOrdering  An array which specifies which columns 
     *                        participate in ordering - see interface 
     *                        ColumnOrdering for details.  The column
     *                        referenced in the 0th columnOrdering object is
     *                        compared first, then the 1st, etc.
     *
     * @param alreadyInOrder  Indicates that the rows inserted into the sort
     *                        controller will already be in order.  This is used
	 *                        to perform aggregation only.
     * 
     * @param estimatedInputRows   The number of rows that the caller estimates
     *                        will be inserted into the sort.  This number must
     *                        be &gt;= 0.
     *
     * @param estimatedExportRows   The number of rows that the caller estimates
     *                        will be exported by the sorter.  For instance if
     *                        the sort is doing duplicate elimination and all
     *                        rows are expected to be duplicates then the 
     *                        estimatedExportRows would be 1.  If no duplicate
     *                        eliminate is to be done then estimatedExportRows 
     *                        would be the same as estimatedInputRows.  This 
     *                        number must be &gt;= 0.
     *
     * @param estimatedRowSize The estimated average row size of the rows 
     *                         being sorted.  This is the client portion of the 
     *                         rowsize, it should not attempt to calculate 
     *                         Store's overhead.  -1 indicates that the caller
     *                         has no idea (and the sorter will use 100 bytes
     *                         in that case.  Used by the sort to make good 
     *                         choices about in-memory vs. external sorting, 
     *                         and to size merge runs.  The client is not
     *                         expected to estimate the per column/ per row 
     *                         overhead of raw store, just to make a guess
     *                         about the storage associated with each row 
     *                         (ie. reasonable estimates for some 
     *                         implementations would be 4 for int, 8 for long,
     *                         102 for char(100), 202 for varchar(200), a
     *                         number out of hat for user types, ...).
     * 
     * @return The cost of the sort.
