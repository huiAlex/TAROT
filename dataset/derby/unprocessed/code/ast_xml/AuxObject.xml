 * This method is called by the page manager when it's about to evict a page which is holding an aux object, or when a rollback occurred on the page.  The aux object should release its resources.  The aux object can assume that no one else has access to it via the raw store during this method call. After this method returns the raw store throws away any reference to this object.
