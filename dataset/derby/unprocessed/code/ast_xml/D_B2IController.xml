    <ClassComment>D_B2IController  /** 
 * Debugging class used to print debug information about a B2I.   Code here can be used in SANE development builds but the class is not necessary for a release so does not add footprint to a customer release. See the DiagnosticableGeneric interface for more information. Note that all the real work currently is inherited from  it's parent, but this class needs to exist as the diagnostic interface requires a class names D_XXX to provide information about XXX.
