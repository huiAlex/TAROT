    <ClassComment>Provider  /** 
 * A provider is an object that others can build dependencies on.  Providers can themselves also be dependents and thus be invalid/revalidated in turn. Revalidating a provider may, as a side-effect, re-validate its dependents -- it is up to the implementation to determine the appropriate action.
