 * Return all information gathered about the scan. &lt;p&gt; This routine returns a list of properties which contains all information gathered about the scan.  If a Property is passed in, then that property list is appeneded to, otherwise a new property object is created and returned. &lt;p&gt; Not all scans may support all properties, if the property is not  supported then it will not be returned.  The following is a list of properties that may be returned. These names have been internationalized, the names shown here are the old, non-internationalized names: scanType - type of the scan being performed: btree heap sort numPagesVisited - the number of pages visited during the scan.  For btree scans this number only includes the leaf pages visited.   numDeletedRowsVisited - the number of deleted rows visited during the scan.  This number includes only those rows marked deleted. numRowsVisited - the number of rows visited during the scan.  This number  includes all rows, including: those marked deleted, those that don't meet qualification, ... numRowsQualified - the number of rows which met the qualification. treeHeight (btree's only) - for btree's the height of the tree.  A tree with one page has a height of 1.  Total number of pages visited in a btree scan is (treeHeight - 1 + numPagesVisited). numColumnsFetched - the number of columns Fetched - partial scans will result in fetching less columns than the total number in the scan. columnsFetchedBitSet - The BitSet.toString() method called on the validColumns arg. to the scan, unless validColumns was set to null, and in that case we will return "all". NOTE - this list will be expanded as more information about the scan is gathered and returned.
 * @param prop   Property list to fill in.
 * @exception StandardException  Standard exception policy.
