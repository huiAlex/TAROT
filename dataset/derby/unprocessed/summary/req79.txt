Add scrollable, updatable, insensitive result sets  
JDBC result sets are created with three properties: type, concurrency
and holdability. The type can be one of TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY,
TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE and TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE. The concurrency can
be one of CONCUR_READ_ONLY and CONCUR_UPDATABLE. The holdability can
be one of HOLD_CURSORS_OVER_COMMIT and CLOSE_CURSORS_AT_COMMIT.
JDBC allows the full cross product of these. SQL 2003 prohibits the
combination
{TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE, CONCUR_UPDATABLE}
, but this
combination is supported by some vendors, notably Oracle.
Currently, Derby supports JDBC result sets in a limited
way. Holdability is supported. Furthermore, the following is
supported:
forward-only, read-only
forward-only, updatable (update, delete, but not insert)
Also, in the network driver, support for some data types
conversions is missing.
scroll insensitive, read-only
We (Fernanda and Andreas will cooperate with me on this) propose a
plan to add support for the combination:
scroll insensitive, updatable
for both the embedded driver and the network client driver.
As a part of this we would also like to add the missing insert
operation to the
{forward-only, updatable}
result sets (JIRA-100), and
remove the requirement for an explicit  FOR UPDATE  clause in the SQL
query to achieve updatability if CONCUR_UPDATABLE is specified
(JIRA-231).
The full proposal text is uploaded as an attachment, including a proposed
functional specification.
This JIRA will  be used to track sub-issues for this effort. The sub-issues will be linked back to this issue.
