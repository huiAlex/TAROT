In various support situations I have seen problems with JDBC metadata stored prepared statements or trigger stored prepared statements that need to be invalidated.  It would be nice to have a way to do this in the field.  For 10.9 a stored procedure would make most sense, but it would be good to have something available in the release branches too.
