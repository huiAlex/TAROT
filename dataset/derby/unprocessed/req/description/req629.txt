Forward-only result sets that are exhausted should be implicitly
closed on the server. This way, ResultSet.close() does not have to
send an explicit close message generating unnecessary network traffic.
The DRDA protocol supports this. From the description of OPNQRY (open
query):
The qryclsimp parameter controls whether the target server
implicitly closes a non-scrollable query upon end of data (SQLSTATE
02000) in association with the cursor type.
