It would be useful to have a tool for dumping the data in a corrupted database. This could start out as a custom tool. After we debug the tool and get some experience with it, we can consider promoting it to be a (possibly undocumented) optional tool which we ship with the product. I think the tool should have the following behavior:
1) The tool should not subvert the security of the corrupted database. If the corrupted database is password-protected, then you would need to present its DBO s credentials in order to use the tool. Naturally, an encryption key would have to be presented in order to decode an encrypted database.
2) The tool should not stop reading a table when it hits a corrupt record. Instead, the tool should soldier on and collect a list of warnings on bad records.
Such a tool would be useful in situations where some part of a heap table is corrupt but the following heap conglomerates are intact:
i) SYSSCHEMAS
ii) SYSTABLES
iii) SYSCONGLOMERATES
iv) SYSCOLUMNS
v) property conglomerate
Such a tool would be useful for some situations where data can t be dumped even after you delete the log files in order to short-circuit recovery.
