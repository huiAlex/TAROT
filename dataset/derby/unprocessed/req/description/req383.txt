Currently, the system properties aren t being used by the runScript() method on the org.apache.derby.tools.ij
This raises an issue with allowing the port used for the JUnit tests to be customized, therefore blocking  . The idea, was to allow properties such as ij.protocol to be set either as system properties, or in a Properties object, then passed to the runScript() method.
Please share any thoughts and ideas as to which may be the best approach.
