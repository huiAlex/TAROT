There must be an entry in the SYSSTATISTICS table in order for the cardinality statistics in SYSSTATISTICS to be created with SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_COMPRESS_TABLE
SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_COMPRESS_TABLE  should create statistics if they don t exist.  The only way to create them if the index was created on an empty table, seems to be to drop and recreate the index after the table has been loaded.
The documentation will also need updating if this change is made.
