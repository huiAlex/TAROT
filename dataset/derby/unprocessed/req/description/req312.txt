One side effect is that the toString() of such a warning would change format from starting with  SQLWarning:   to  java.sql.SQLWarning:  , which should match any warnings created on the network client side.
See comments in   as well for possible correct package of SQLWarningFactory.
Note: generateCsSQLWarning() can be removed as it doesn t seem to be used.
Note: Also SQLWarningFactory would not extend java.sql.SQLWarning.
