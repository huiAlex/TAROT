I tried running Derby on Oracle Java ME Embedded Client 1.0, and booting the engine failed:
Caused by: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: java.nio.channels.OverlappingFileLockException
This seems to happen because Derby recognizes it as a Java 1.4 platform, whereas it s actually a CDC/FP 1.1.2 platform.
