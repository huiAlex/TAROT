If a unique constraint is violated by an insert statement, then Derby throws an SQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException. The error message contains, in particular, the constraint name and the table name.
To distinguish between cases with various constraints, Derby should instead throw a subclass of SQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException, with methods like getConstraintName(), and getTableName().
