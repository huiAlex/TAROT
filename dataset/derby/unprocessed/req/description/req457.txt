Users often on bad advice or desperation  touch or delete files in the log or seg0 directories (mostly log).
I think it would be good for new databases and on upgrade that a file be created in these directories with a name like:
TOUCHING_FILES_HERE_WILL_CORRUPT_DB_README.txt
or some such to warn of the perils of doing this and the corrupting effects and how it can eliminate any possibility of salvage. It should also encourage users to make a zip backup of the database directory with no jvm currently accessing it before trying to do anything with the database if it appears to be already corrupt.  Also point to backup/restore documentation and encourage restore of a good backup into an empty directory if the database is corrupt.
I m not sure if it would help but it couldn t hurt.
