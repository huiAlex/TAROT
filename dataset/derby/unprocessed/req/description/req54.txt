The new OFFSET/FETCH syntax does not support Parameters.
From ij against the toursdb I would like to do the following:
ij&gt; prepare foo as  select * from cities offset ? rows fetch first 10 rows only ;
but results in the following syntax error:
ERROR 42X01: Syntax error: Encountered  ?  at line 1, column 29.
Parameterized OFFSET/FETCH is important for performance (can be prepared) and security (SQL strings not created on the fly).
