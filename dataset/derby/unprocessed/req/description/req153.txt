A UNION node will generate byte code to call this method:
NoPutResultSet getUnionResultSet(NoPutResultSet source1,
NoPutResultSet source2,
Activation activation,
int resultSetNumber,
double optimizerEstimatedRowCount,
double optimizerEstimatedCost,
GeneratedMethod closeCleanup)
The closeCleanup method is passed in as null for all result sets in a tree except the top one. Instead of passing it on each new result set, it would be much more efficient to have a setCloseMethod() that is only called once for the top result set.  Could also look at having an closeCleanup method in the interface and call it directly, rather than through reflection.
This applies to any node that takes a closeCleanup method.
