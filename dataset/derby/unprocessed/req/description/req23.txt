Add an MBean that an application can register to change the state of Derby s JMX management
JMX in Derby was originally proposed as a mechanism to configure Derby replacing or enhancing the system properties which tend to be static in nature. Thus it is somewhat ironic that jmx is enabled with a static system property derby.system.jmx.
I propose to add a public mbean that allows the state Derby s JMX management to be changed. This bean is not automatically registered by Derby if derby.system.jmx is false, but instead can be registered by an application. I believe this could occur at any time so that JMX could be enabled on a running application, possibly by a remote client.
This standard Mbean (o.a.d.mbeans.Management &amp; ManagementMBean) would have these operations &amp; attribute:
public boolean isManagementActive();
public void startManagement();
public void stopManagement();
If Derby is not booted within the jvm then the operations would be no-ops.
If derby.system.jmx is true then Derby will itself register an mbean that implements ManagementMBean to allow dynamic control of the visibility of Derby s mbeans.
