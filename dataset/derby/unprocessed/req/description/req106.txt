Would like to see support added for sequences.  This would permit a select against the sequence to always obtain a ever increasing/decreasing value.  The identity column works fine but there are times for applications where the application needs to obtain the sequence number and use it prior to the database write.  Subsequent calls to the table/column would result in a new number on each call.
SQL such as the following:
SELECT NEXT VALUE FOR sequence_name FROM sometable ; would result in a next value.
