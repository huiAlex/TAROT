Nicolas Dufour in an email thread titled  functions and list  started on November 2, 2005 requests the ability to create user defined aggregates.
This functionality used to be in Cloudscape. It was disabled presumably because it was considered non-standard. However, most of the machinery needed for this feature is still in the code. We should re-enable user defined aggregates after we agree on acceptable syntax.
