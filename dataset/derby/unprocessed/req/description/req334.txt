I was creating a test database on an external USB drive formatted as FAT32- it contains some tables that have quite large binary objects in: This was in conjunction with Hibernate. I got this rather cryptic error message.
Looks rather scary:
18:02:37,550  WARN JDBCExceptionReporter:77 - SQL Error: 40000, SQLState: 08006
18:02:37,550 ERROR JDBCExceptionReporter:78 - A network protocol error was encountered and the connection has been terminated: the requested command encountered an unarchitected and implementation-specific condition for which there was no architected message
18:02:37,597 ERROR AbstractFlushingEventListener:301 - Could not synchronize database state with session
org.hibernate.exception.JDBCConnectionException: could not insert:  &#91;proteinChainMoleculeBinaryData&#93;
java:2263)
Initially it didnt even occur to me that this may be due to me using a FAT32 drive, but eventually I figured out that the table s file had got to the operating FAT32 limit: I had a file of 4,194,272 KB.
In the derby log, there s a more revealing, but still incorrect, error message:
ERROR XSDG1: Page Page(131071,Container(0, 2384)) could not be written to disk, please check if disk is full.
Caused by: java.io.IOException: There is not enough space on the disk

at sun.nio.ch.IOUtil.write(IOUtil.java:75)
at sun.nio.ch.FileChannelImpl.write(FileChannelImpl.java:651)
The error is still strictly speaking incorrect - my disk is far from full, but I have created a file too big for the disk type - but the error is at least closer to the truth and this would be useful information for the derby client to display rather than the rather scary looking message I was getting.
