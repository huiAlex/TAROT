It would be good for Derby to have built in Language based ordering based on locale specific Collator.
Language based ordering is an important feature for international deployment.    offers one implementation option for this but according to the discussion in that issue National Character Types carry a fair amount of baggage with them especially in the form of concerns about conversion   to and from datetime and number types. Rick  mentioned SQL language for collations as an option for language based ordering. There may be other options too, but I thought it worthwhile to add an issue for the high level functional concern, so the best choice can be made for implementation without assuming that National Character Types is the only solution.
For possible 10.1 workaround and examples see:
If a user specifies a create database url like following
jdbc:derby:abcDB;create=true;collation=TERRITORY_BASED
we should ignore the collation attribute because no territory attribute has been specified. The current Derby 10.3 code does not do that. Once this is fixed, we should add a test case for it in CollationTest.java
