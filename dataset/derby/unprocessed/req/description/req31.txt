Investigate if largeData/LobLimits.java  can be run for client
When investigating  , I noticed that the largeData suite does not run for client. The comment in suites/derbyNetClient.exclude says:
excluding TestErrorStreamTarget.java since it s not relevant for clients
excluding largedata/LobLimits.java to run with the network server because curr
ently lobs are materialized and this test tests for 2G lobs.
see   and   issues
#
largedata/LobLimits.java
Perhaps now that these issues are fixed the test can be run in client. Perhaps it should be a separate suite as just the embedded test takes over 10 hours to run.
