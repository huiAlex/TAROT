Derby presently does not implement support for the method
PreparedStatement.setObject (and similarly for CallableStatement.setObject)
when the supplied value is null, unless a type argument (3rd arg) is also present.
That is, in:
void setObject(int parameterIndex,
Object x)
throws SQLException
x can not be null.
Derby will presently throw an SQLException (client: XJ021, embedded: 22005)
if x is null when calling this method on a preparedStatement.
Porting some applications may be made easier if this restriction is lifted.
