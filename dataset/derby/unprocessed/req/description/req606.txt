The code contains backup methods both for specifying the backup directory both as a String and as a File parameter.  Only the String versions are currently used.  The File versions should be removed to avoid duplication of code etc.
Examples of such methods are:
BasicDatabase.backup
BasicDatabase.backupAndEnableLogArchiveMode
RAMAccessManager.backup
RAMAccessManager.backupAndEnableLogArchiveMode
RawStore.backupAndEnableLogArchiveMode
plus corresponding interfaces.
