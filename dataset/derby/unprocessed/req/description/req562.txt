I ve found that many methods that generate messages could be collapsed into a single method using varargs. Right now, many of them exist in multiple variants, typically for zero up to three or four message arguments.
Examples:
Monitor.logTextMessage()
MessageService.getTextMessage()
Constructors in SqlException and SqlWarning
