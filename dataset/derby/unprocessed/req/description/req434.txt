Somewhat simplified, the release manager (RM) must currently perform the following manual steps to feed the release note generate the data it needs:
a) Create manual JIRA filter to select issues addressed by the release.
b) Save the filter result to disk as XML.
c) Write/modify the XML parser to be able to parse the report.
d) Determine and record all JIRA release note attachment ids for the issues requiring a release note.
By using the current version of the SOAP API (3.13.5), steps (b) to (d) can be removed.
