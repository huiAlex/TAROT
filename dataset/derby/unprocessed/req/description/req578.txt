I identified some unused code; a flag that is always false, and code for handling triggers in bulk insert which is unused (by inspection and corroborated by JaCoCo results for our regression tests): we disable bulk insert if there are triggers present, cf.
DMLModStatementNode#getAllRelevantTriggers -&gt;
adjustDeferredFlag(true)
InsertResultSet#bulkInsert:
bulkInsert = verifyBulkInsert()-&gt;
:
// bulk insert is disabled for deferred mode inserts
if (constants.deferred)
return false;
