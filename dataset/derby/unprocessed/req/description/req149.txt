From work on   &amp;    it was discovered the DependencyMangerImpl  loaded the same Provier multiple times from the DataDictionary while loading the stored dependecies and converting them to an in-memory form.  There is no need to load the Provider from the  DataDictionary because it is passed into the DependencyManger.invalidateFor call that results in the loading of the stored dependencies.
