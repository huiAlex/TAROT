[S1] A chronic special-diagnosis-history patient is an alive patient who has been diagnosed with at least one of the following:
diabetes mellitus [is diagnosed with ICD code beginning with 250:http://icd9cm.chrisendres.com/icd9cm/index.php?action=child&recordid=1894 ],
asthma [is diagnosed with ICD code beginning with 493:http://icd9cm.chrisendres.com/icd9cm/index.php?action=child&recordid=5000 ], or
circulatory-system disease [is diagnosed with an ICD code between 390 and 459 inclusive: http://icd9cm.chrisendres.com/icd9cm/index.php?action=child&recordid=4314 ].
[S2] The patient list is titled with the HCP's name. The patient list includes the patient's name (i.e., first name and last name), phone number, and contact email address [E1] (so that confirmation calls or emails can be made or sent outside of the iTrust system). The list is sorted based on the ascending alphabetical order of the patients' last names, and then first names. When a chronic special-diagnosis-history patient satisfies all three conditions and has multiple prescriptions satisfying the third condition, the patient is listed in the list only once. The list is a static list with no link on the patient's name, phone number, or contact email address)
