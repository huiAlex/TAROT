Any event which creates, views, edits, or deletes information is logged [S2]. Login failures, valid authentication, and log outs are also logged [S1]. Individual audit codes related to specific use cases are presented within each Use Case description.
Note: The subflow and transaction values are based on Use Case. For example, any in the range of 100-199 are for use case one, any in the range of 200-299 are in use case two. The values from range 1-99 are logging events which do not exist in any use case. Miscellaneous transaction codes 1-99 are presented in 5.5 below.
