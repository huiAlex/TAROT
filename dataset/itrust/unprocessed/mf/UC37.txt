While documenting an office visit, the HCP selects to prescribe a patient a drug by selecting its NDC and name [S1, S2]. Upon notice of allergies and/or interactions the HCP must either choose to proceed with the prescription [S3] or cancel the prescription and remain on the office visit page. The administrator maintains the override reasons that an HCP can select from [S4].
