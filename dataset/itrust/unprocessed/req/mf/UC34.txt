An LHCP or UAP creates a list of patients by adding and confirming patients (by MID) for which he or she will monitor remotely [E1, S1]. A patient either chooses to input his or her physiologic measurements (blood pressure and/or glucose levels) [S2], or to input his or her weight, height, and/or pedometer readings [S7]. An LHCP can see the blood pressure and glucose levels [S3], or weight, height, and pedometer readings [S8] for the patients he or she is monitoring, with two separate lists for physiologic and height/weight/pedometer readings [S3]. A UAP [S5 & S9] or patient representative [S6 & S10] can input the blood pressure, glucose levels, height, weight, or pedometer readings for a patient. A patient may have up to 10 physiologic data points in any one day, reported by him/herself, a UAP, or a personal representative [E4]. A patient may have at most one height data point, one weight data point, and one pedometer data point in any one day, reported by him/herself, a UAP, or a personal representative [E6].
