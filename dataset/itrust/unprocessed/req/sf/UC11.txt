The event is logged (UC 5, S8) and the HCP is returned in the specific office visit record to verify his or her changes.
[S4] The HCP has selected a medication prescribed from a pull down list. The HCP provides the dosage in milligrams, the start and end date for the prescription, and any special instructions.

The HCP must provide instructions (can neither be empty nor the default form field value), or else they cannot add the prescription. The HCP can add the prescription to the list of medications (UC37).
