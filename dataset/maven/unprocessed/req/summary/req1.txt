Make plugin discovery reactor aware
If plugin discovery is reactor aware, plugins that are part of a reactor build and are used to aid the build
can be used in one go. Else first the plugin should be installed, and then the rest of the project can
be built.
But mainly this aids in integration testing for plugins: the maven-it-plugin in sandbox can t add the current plugin
+ artifact to the lifecycle without making some methods public. If the plugin were to be discovered using the reactor,
those methods can remain private.
See thread   for details.
