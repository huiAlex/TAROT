Extensions like Tycho employ custom repo layouts to access P2 or OBR repos. When it comes to mirroring, it s desirable to use different mirrors for the normal Maven repos and those OSGi repos. Neverthess, users should still be able to use wildcards for easy mirror maintenance but a wildcard matches any repo regardless of its layout/type. So we should enrich the settings model to allow the specification of a layout for the mirror itself that can be considered when selecting a mirror for a specific repository.
