Every now and then I want to exclude one or more modules from a rather large reactor build.
One reason for this can be: The respective module has tests that take long time to execute and I know that I don t need to execute them.
Introducing yet another profile for this is not desirable for various reasons.
So, something like an opposite to -pl would come in handy. Let s say  -el  for  exclude list .
Example:
root
+ module a
+ module a1
+ module a2
+ module b
+ module b1
+ module c
Calling  mvn -el a1,c  would build all modules execpt a1 and c.
