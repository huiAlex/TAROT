At the moment, when someone thinks there is a problem, the only way to investigate is to write new unit tests in ComparableVersionTest
a little CLI tool to display the parsed version (in its canonical form) and comparing arguments would be useful
$ java -jar maven-artifact-*.jar 3.2.4-alpha-1 3.2.4-SNAPSHOT 3.2.4.0
Display parameters as parsed by Maven (in canonical form) and comparison result:
1. 3.2.4-alpha-1 == 3.2.4.alpha.1
3.2.4-alpha-1 &lt; 3.2.4-SNAPSHOT
2. 3.2.4-SNAPSHOT == 3.2.4.snapshot
3.2.4-SNAPSHOT &lt; 3.2.4.0
3. 3.2.4.0 == 3.2.4
