Add CLI option to control location of global settings from command line
The system properties  org.apache.maven.user-settings  and  org.apache.maven.global-settings  are no longer supported by Maven 3.x. While the first one can easily be replaced by the existing CLI option  --settings , there is currently no possibility to control the location of the global settings.
Full control of the settings is helpful in CI and our own ITs.
