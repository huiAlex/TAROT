In Maven 2.x, build extensions can only contribute components that realize a custom impl of some API defined by the Maven core like artifact handlers and lifecycle mappings. However, to support things like Tycho in a stock Maven distro, we need a build extension to provide components that
a) realize APIs defined merely by the extension and are unknown to Maven itself
b) can be looked up and accessed via API from the extension and other plugins in the same project
c) can be shared among all projects in the reactor using the same extension, including state kept by singletons
