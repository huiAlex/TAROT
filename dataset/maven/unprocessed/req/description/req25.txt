Can we get a flag to mvn, which will set all snapshot repos updatePolicy to never?
I m trying to get a build that will always use locally installed snapshots, but allow new deps to be downloaded if needed.  All I can think of now is to create a new profile which redefines all of the snapshot repos with &lt;updatePolicy&gt;never&lt;/updatePolicy&gt;... but that gets messy as I need to add a profile to every pom that defines a repo.
Would it be hard to implement  a simple cli flag, like  nsu ( -no-snapshot-updates) which will just force all snap repos to never update?  This would be very, very, very helpful for automated builds, when the local repo cache is known to have the right deps.
