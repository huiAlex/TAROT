/**
 * The concern of the project is provide runtime values based on the model.
 * 
 * The values in the model remain untouched but during the process of building a project notions like inheritance and
 * interpolation can be added. This allows to have an entity which is useful in a runtime while preserving the model so
 * that it can be marshalled and unmarshalled without being tainted by runtime requirements.
 * 
 * 
 * With changes during 3.2.2 release MavenProject is closer to being immutable after construction with the removal of
 * all components from this class, and the upfront construction taken care of entirely by the @{ProjectBuilder}. There
 * is still the issue of having to run the lifecycle in order to find all the compile source roots and resource
 * directories but I hope to take care of this during the Maven 4.0 release (jvz).
