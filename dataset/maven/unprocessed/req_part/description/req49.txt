&lt;exists&gt; also is a valid tag inside that &lt;file&gt; as well.
The problem with this patch atm is that it ceases to work outside of the context of the subproject it exists in..
this is because in the FileExistenceProfileActivator we have no mechanism of getting the absolute path for that file string.
I looked into BuildBase object that you can get from the Profile passed in but it is empty (null) and the string doesn t resolve expressions either...
so...if I can get pointed in the right direction for adding that expression resolution in there I ll put that in...talked to kenney about this a bit on irc this morning as well and he seemed to think that was probably the way to go.
