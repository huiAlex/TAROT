This is essentially the same issue as MPARTIFACT-59, but for the Maven 2 code base.
When the current version contains SNAPSHOT, every deploy creates a SNAPSHOT artifact and an artifact with a date/time.  This causes a LOT of artifacts being created when using a continuous build.  Would like to see this  feature  configurable, so I can turn it off at the very least or have it happen only when I want to or on a scheduled basis.
On a related note, I think it would be good for the date/timestamped version to still contain the word SNAPSHOT.  This way, it s very easy to determine whether a project currently has dependencies on snapshot (unreleased) versions.  I can parse for the date/time format as well, but the common SNAPSHOT keyword would be easier.
