Say you have this project structure:
/
|-- module1
|-- module2
and artifactIds are named:
my-parent
|-- my-module1
|-- my-module2
Prefix  my-  is omitted for brevity in module names. For instance, Jersey does that.
When the SCM report is built, the artifactId is always used for path composition which leads to incorrect URLs. You can of course set the parameter  checkoutDirectoryName  but this would be extremely tedious for all modules down the tree.
The code should obtain the module name and use it for URL composition.
