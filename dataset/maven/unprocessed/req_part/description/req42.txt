Error when running stock Tycho 0.16.0
Exception in thread  main  java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.apache.maven.execution.MavenSession.getRepositoryCache()Lorg/apache/maven/artifact/repository/RepositoryCache;
This method was deprecated but it can be bridged to Aether code as this screws up Tycho users unecessarily. Tycho can migrate off this method but currently this breaks all Tycho users which is an unacceptable break.
