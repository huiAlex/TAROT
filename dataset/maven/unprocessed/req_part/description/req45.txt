Provide finer grained control over how a &lt;configuration/&gt; is processed before handing a final mojo configuration over the Configurator which takes the configuration and applies it to the Mojo. My specific use case is that I want to allow many mojos to be configured clearly by scoping the configuration for a Mojo by Mojo name.
