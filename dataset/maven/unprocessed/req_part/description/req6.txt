Is it possible for Maven to use ANSI color logging? IMO it would make Maven logs much easier to read and increase the visibility of items that the user want to see at any given point in time.
I think Andrew Williams did some work under Plexus sandbox to enable color logging. There also a color logger available in Ant.
