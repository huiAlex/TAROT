Sometimes when splitting up big modules into child modules I muck up, and end up with multiple children with the same artifactId, which causes trouble later.
It would be nice if at the time when m2 is building the list of all children of a module and ordering them and stuff, if it could warn or throw an error if there are multiple children with the same artifactId - I presume this would only cut in if they also had the same groupId.
