Make Infinispan use its own thread pool for sending messages in order to avoid thread deadlocks  
when an OOB thread sends a sync request it blocks waiting on a sync in jgroups RequestCorrelator
it gets released by an another OOB thread when the remote node responds
Now if all the OOB threads are blocked in sending, then there s no available OOB thread to unblock them even if responses from remote nodes have arrived - deadlock. In order to avoid this deadlock we can use a different thread pool for sending OOB messages.
