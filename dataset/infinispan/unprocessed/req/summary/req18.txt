Configure the Java Hot Rod client to always go to the main data owner when requesting data
ATM the HR client picks randomly a node owner when it writes data.
With   in place, this is suboptimal, as during writes the secondary owner delegates the write to the main owner for lock acquisition, which means an additional RPC. We should make the HR client always write to the main data owner directly.
