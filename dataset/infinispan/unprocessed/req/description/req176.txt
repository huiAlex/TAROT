Create an abstraction for org.jgroups.PhysicalAddress in Infinispan so that Transport can return getPhysicalAddress();
RpcManagerImpl could then call t.getPhysicalAddress() and show that via jmx/jopr. Having the physical address information available from jmx/jopr on top of the logical address will help users debug issues more easily.
