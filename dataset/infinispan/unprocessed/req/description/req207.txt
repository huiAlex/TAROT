As opposed to the current listener approach in Infinispan ( a listener instance is invoked on the data owners ), this JIRA is about adding support for a cluster listener: the same listener instance that is notified disregarding of data ownership ( RPC calls involved).
Due to the fact that the listener notification might involve an RPC, it is nice to be able to specify filters on these listeners.
The clustered listener support opens the way for some interesting architectures:
persistent/continuous queries: the query is transformed in a filter. On each notification, the listener (stateful) updates the query state
simplistic CEP can be built on top of the persistent query described above
remote/hotrod notifications might be based on clustered listeners as well.
