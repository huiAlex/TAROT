Please create some support for near-cache pattern for distributed cache. Some detailed description could be found in Oracle Coherence documentation    or in Cameron Purdy presentation
It is based on combination of L1 caching in local JVM of application with combination of L2 cache based on distributed cache cluster on other servers. I tried to implement this myself, but HotRod does not support Client-side listeners (The UnsupportedOperationException is thrown).  It could be cool, if I could register some kind of eviction listener on client side and use it for invalidation of records in local cache based on event from remote distributed cache (L2).
Some kind of workaround was described in   :  We don t have L1s yet, but you could implement Cache Listeners on the server side and use JMS to notify your clients and build an L1 that way.
Thanks for so great cache like infinispan is.
