We want to be able to allocate data off-heap.
Requirements / ideas:
data should be stored in Direct ByteBuffers, or easily accessible as such so that integration with other types of I/O (clustering, persistence, server) can be done efficiently
consider both raw  byte storage (such as that performed by servers) and store as binary
allocator should be pluggable
out-of-the-box implementation should use Netty Buffers
type of allocation (heap or off-heap) should be per-cache
off-heap allocation configuration should be global (per-container) or possibly shared among multiple containers
optional off-heap allocation for keys
ability to monitor both global and per-cache memory usage
