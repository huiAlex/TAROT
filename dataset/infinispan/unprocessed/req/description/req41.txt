/META-INF/services/org.infinispan.persistence.spi.AdvancedCacheWriter
/META-INF/services/org.infinispan.persistence.spi.AdvancedCacheLoader
/META-INF/services/org.infinispan.persistence.spi.CacheLoader
/META-INF/services/org.infinispan.persistence.spi.CacheWriter
/META-INF/services/org.infinispan.persistence.spi.ExternalStore
/META-INF/services/org.infinispan.persistence.spi.AdvancedLoadWriteStore
