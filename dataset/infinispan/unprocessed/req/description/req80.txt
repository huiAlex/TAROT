After merging the round of pull requests today (including  ), there still is an issue where a killed node can appear in the CH even after JGroups passes up the new view.  This appears to happen when the old coordinator was killed.
Obviously, if the CH contains the old member, writes that map to the segments previously owned by the dead node will fail.
Here are ISPN trace logs.  You are looking for erm-cluster.
(phl-dg1)
(phl-dg2)
(phl-dg3, the node that was killed)
