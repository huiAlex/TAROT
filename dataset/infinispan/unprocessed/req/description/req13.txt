The current algorithm has 4 messages in the network (worst case) happended sequentially:
1: originator =&gt; primary owner
2: primary owner =&gt; backups
3: backups =&gt; primary owner (ack)
4: primary owner =&gt; originator (reply)
The algorithm can be improved to the following:
1: originator =&gt; primary owner
2: primary owner =&gt; backups &amp; primary owner =&gt; originator (parallel)
3: backups =&gt; originator &amp; backups =&gt; primary owners (acks)
The main flow would be: originator =&gt; primary =&gt; backups =&gt; originator (&lt;= there is the triangle   )
