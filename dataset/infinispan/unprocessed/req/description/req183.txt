The extended statistics allows to profile Infinispan. It will be implemented a two separated modules:
The first will give information like, for example, average transaction execution, message sizes, number of operations per transaction, etc.
In addition, the second module will support the called top-key streaming. This technique allows to check which are the most accessed/locked/etc. keys in the application.
I ll made the full list of the current implemented statistics soon.
