This will prevent loading too much into memory causing OOMs, as well as unnecessary eviction thread churn.  Probably would require another CacheLoader interface method such as loadAll(int maxEntries).  A default version of this method could just call loadAll() and trim the resultset to size, and more sophisticated impls could only load the necessary number of entries, such as a LIMIT SQL query for the JDBC cache stores.
