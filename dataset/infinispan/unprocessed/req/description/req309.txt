We needed to be able to configure state transfer providers and consumers separately. The short term strategy is to make each node a provider. We then use the &#39;fetchInMemoryState&#39; attribute to determine if a node can be a consumer or not.
org.infinispan.factories.StateTransferManagerFactory
Updated to remove the &#39;isStateTransferEnabled&#39; check. Now every node is a state transfer provider.
org.infinispan.statetransfer.StateTransferManagerImpl
public void start()
Updated to now check the &#39;fetchInMemoryState&#39; attribute to determine if this node can operate as a consumer.
public void generateState()
Updated so that any node can generate the state.
