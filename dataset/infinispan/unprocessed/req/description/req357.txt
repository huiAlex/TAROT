Infinispan supports a very flexible way of configuring caches using multiple levels of inheritance.
While this is really nice, it is sometimes not easy to understand how exactly a particular cache was configured.
(E.g. JPA is just one example where a cache configuration can be adjusted in several ways).
JMX or debuggers help but may not always be available.
What about allowing to convert a configuration instance back to XML to give a quick overview of the really applied settings.  (Optionally it might also be a nice little feature to implement a  toXmlString();  method or override the default and also make this available through JMX)
JAXB annotations are already present on all configurable options but a couple getters and a @XmlRootElement annotation is missing that would allow to convert an existing instance back to XML. The effort in doing this should be rather low.

This feature request may also fit with #  as it would allow to transfer cache configs using XML.
