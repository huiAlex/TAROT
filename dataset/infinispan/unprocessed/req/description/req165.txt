Two issues:
1. StateTransferInterceptor.handleTxCommand, when invoking handleTopologyAffectedCommand internally, wrongly calculates the 2nd param of the invocation
2. StateTransferInterceptor.handleTopologyAffectedCommand
This logic filters out commands that should be forwarded (e.g. late commands that happened before state transfer completed):
if   (pendingCh !=   null   &amp;&amp; cmdTopologyId &lt; localTopologyId +   1  ) {
ConsistentHash writeCh = cacheTopology.getWriteConsistentHash();
Set&lt;Object&gt; affectedKeys = getAffectedKeys(ctx, command);
Set&lt;Address&gt; newTargets = writeCh.locateAllOwners(affectedKeys);
newTargets.remove(rpcManager.getAddress());
if   (!newTargets.isEmpty()) {
// Update the topology id to prevent cycles
command.setTopologyId(localTopologyId);
log.tracef(   Forwarding command %s to new targets %s   , command, newTargets);
// TODO find a way to forward the command async if it was received async
rpcManager.invokeRemotely(newTargets, command,   true  ,   false  );
}
}
The if above should be removed.
