When running unit tests for a system that uses Infinispan, the log is filled with the following messages:
INFO ISPN000128: Infinispan version: Infinispan  Brahma  5.1.0.BETA4
It looks like this may be logged each time an Infinispan cache manager is instantiated, but it would be really nice if this were done only once, perhaps in a static initializer for one of the classes. This would likely mean little change for production systems.
