The new failover policy enhancements behave differently than the 5.1 release.  The default is a random failover, which causes problems in my environment due to pessimistic locks being acquired.  The default policy should be  none
Secondly, if a user specifies a key set, the failover policy should respect that.  Using pessimistic locks as an example, a valid optimization would be to submit on the local data owner to avoid additional RPCs.  A random node failover policy really doesn t fit in this case.
