We need CacheManager s to expose some kind of name or id that differenciates them from the rest.
The jmxDomain is not enough since you could have different machines running different VMs deploying the CacheManager instances with the same jmxDomain and this is valid.
The reason we need this is so that Jopr can show different cache manager s amongst their resources. Currently, it can only show one.
