This should be for people extending or simply mocking Infinispan for tests, etc.  Perhaps this should implement AdvancedCache.  In any case, this abstract delegate should take in an AdvancedCache in its constructor and delegate all calls to the AdvancedCache.
Perhaps called AbstractDelegatingCache ?
