Cache s entrySet/keySet/values implementations do not take into account that entries might have expired, so the collections returned might contain key/value pairs that should be removed.
This has the side effect of getBulk remote cache operation returning entries even after their lifespan ends. From Martin:
This is related to a getBulk operation on an Infinispan HotRod client.
Simple test snippet that fails ATM:
Map&lt;String,String&gt; mapIn = new HashMap&lt;String,String&gt;() ;
Map&lt;String,String&gt; mapOut = new HashMap&lt;String,String&gt;() ;
mapOut.put( aKey ,  aValue );
mapOut.put( bKey ,  bValue );
remoteCache.putAll(mapOut, lifespanInSecs, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
sleepForSecs(lifespanInSecs) ;
mapIn = remoteCache.getBulk();
assertTrue(mapIn.size() == 0);  //fails, entries are still there
However, when I call remoteCache.get(&lt;key&gt;); for all the keys and then getBulk, the getBulk return empty map.
So it seems the get operations cause the entries to be removed from the cache. Please implement this also for getBulk operation or reject it with an explanation.
