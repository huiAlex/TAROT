When registering a listener, users should be able to provide a  KeyFilter , a simple interface that determines whether a listener is invoked or not based on whether the affected key(s) matches the filter.
The proposed API may overload the  addListener(Object listener)  method on  Cache , adding:
void addListener(Object listener, KeyFilter filter);
where  KeyFilter  may be an interface that looks like:
&nbsp;
public interface KeyFilter {
&nbsp;
boolean match(Object key);
&nbsp;
}
