Currently there is a 1:1 relationship between configuration and named caches. While the programmatic API does have the ability to .read() an existing configuration to create a new one, the declarative config does not.
We should introduce the concept of configuration inheritance, e.g.:
&lt;local-cache name= eviction-cache &gt;
&lt;eviction strategy= LIRS  maxEntries= 10000 /&gt;
&lt;/local-cache&gt;
&nbsp;
&lt;local-cache name= mycache  template= eviction-cache  /&gt;
Possibly, cache templates should be made  abstract  so that they cannot be instantiated as named caches directly, e.g.:
&lt;local-cache name= eviction-cache  abstract= true &gt;
&lt;/local-cache&gt;
