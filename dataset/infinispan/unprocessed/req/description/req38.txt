Build a server module based on the HotRod protocol
Could be based on existing JBoss Remoting components which have the capability to handle load balancing and faoliver.  Needs to share some components with   so that protocol parsing code isn t repeated.  May also share some components with   so that abstract transport and socket handling code is reused.
Will also need a comprehensive wiki page detailing usage and demonstration.
