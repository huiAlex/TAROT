ReplicateCommand should be split into SingleRPCCommand, MultipleRPCCommand:
name is more suggestive, ReplicateCommand  name is very simillr to ReplicableCommand which makes code hard to read
when only replicating a single command, the current impl is inefficient as it internally builds an array to store the single entry. This is not needed.
