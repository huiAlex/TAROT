Problem:
cache.getAdvancedCache().addInterceptorAfter(new ErrorInducingInterceptor(), NonTransactionalLockingInterceptor.class);
if NonTransactionalLockingInterceptor doesn t exist in the chain then the method return silently without informing the user that it didn t succeed. This is not API friendly.
Suggested solution: throw an exception to inform the user that his attempt is not correct.
