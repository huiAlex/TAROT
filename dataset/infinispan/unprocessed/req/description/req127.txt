This is just a proposal, feel free to reject.
Default behaviour in PropsKeyedObjectPoolFactory is
minIdle = 1
timeBetweenEvictionRunsMillis = 2min
i.e. after 2minutes of idle RemoteCacheManager will try to ensure at least one connection and will try to create one.
This might be a surprise for user to get this WARNING without doing anything:
2012-01-26 15:05:00,816 138699 WARN   (Timer-1:) ISPN004008: Could not connect to server: test1/192.168.11.101:11222

of course it s easy to change this via  minIdle  property, I just think this is a strange default and IMHO it should be 0 instead of 1.
WDYT?
