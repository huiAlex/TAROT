Allow modifying eviction size through both JMX and DMR  
If a cache is bounded, we need to be able to modify the eviction size at runtime both through JMX and DMR  .  
Make eviction size parameter configurable at runtime
I ve got a use-case where I would like to be able to dynamically (at runtime) configure the max-entries parameter of my eviction configuration. This would allow to, for example, decrease the max-entries dynamically when my system starts running oom.
