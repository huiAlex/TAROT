exposes entry iteration via Hot Rod and allows to filter based on segments.
In order to be able to eventually calculate the segments to be filtered on, ownership information for a cache needs to be exposed as well.
API suggestion by @wburns:
Set&lt;Integer&gt; getSegments()
Map&lt;Address, Set&lt;Integer&gt;&gt; getSegmentsByServer()
