&#91;11:07:36&#93;  &lt;pilhuhn&gt; how can I  get the cluster partition name in as7 Similar to what was in as4/5 ? Is that now on subsystem=infinispan/cache=*:aliases ?
&#91;11:32:15&#93;  &lt;+galderz&gt; pilhuhn, i don t think we re exposing it:
&#91;11:32:30&#93;  &lt;+galderz&gt; we could expose it via the cache manager
&#91;11:33:12&#93;  &lt;+galderz&gt; pilhuhn, can u add a jira for that?
For as7, this needs to be exposed within the as7 management tree.
