Currently, a JGroupsChannelLookup can indicate whether the JGroupsTransport should connect the provided channel and disconnect/close the provided channel.
In the case of Wildfly, we d like to distinguish between disconnect and close.  We have a service that provided the channel, but we allow the JGroupsTransport to manage the lifecycle. This leads to conditions where infinispan s cache manager can restart, but the jgroups channel service does not, e.g.
To fix this, I need to introduce hacks into the channel returned by the channel service, such that Channel.close() is a no-op, and introduce a separate method invisible to Infinispan to perform the actual close().
So what I propose is the following:
boolean shouldConnect();  // Notice that I renamed this, because there is no such distinction between  start  and  connect .
boolean shouldDisconnect();
boolean shouldClose();
