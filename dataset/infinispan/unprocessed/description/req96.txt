It seems that when looking in the classpath for instances of  infinispan-module.properties  files, nothing is logged. No idea why it s not loading an extension.
Also specific modules should log their registration happening:
org.infinispan.tree.LifecycleCallbacks  should mention that it s being enabled.
(when registration of such a module doesn t happen, people experience misleading errors)
