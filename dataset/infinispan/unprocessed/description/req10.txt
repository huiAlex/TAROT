currently the schema for the clustering mode says it s a string and
the mode is decided by first letter of the string. this means that any garbage starting with the correct letter may lead to use of a specific mode e.g.:
lasjadgadfg -&gt; local
rhdbhgh -&gt; replication
dfghbmjfgh -&gt; distribution
IlkHhdf -&gt; invalidation
what about forcing only the documented values
For distribution, set mode to either  d ,  dist  or  distribution . For replication, use either  r ,  repl  or  replication . Finally, for invalidation,  i ,  inv  or  invalidation .
+ LOCAL
