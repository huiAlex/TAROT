Currently, EmbeddedCacheManager provides no mechanism to retrieve a defined cache configuration without starting the corresponding cache.
Formerly, one could achieve this via the defineConfiguration(String, Configuration) method, by passing in an empty Configuration object, however, this will not work with the new configuration API - the returned object will always be equivalent the one passed in.
