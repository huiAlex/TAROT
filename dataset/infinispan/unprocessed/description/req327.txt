It would be nice if the Cache events were generic, and save the user from needless casting.  e.g. CacheEntryActivatedEvent&lt;K, V&gt;
This would also further discourage users from fetching values from their own generic Cache&lt;K, V&gt; rather than having to cast the values from the event or DataContainer (a potential gotcha, see  ).
Type erasure should ensure that any current unparameterized usage is fully compatible.
