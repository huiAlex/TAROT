DistributionInterceptor, as it looks now is unnecessary complex. Before adding more functionality on top of it (i.e.  ) it should be refactored:
extract L1 logic into a different interceptor
this would require moving the StateTransferLock logic into another interceptor as well
now that we have separation between tx and non-tx caches, we can extract the remaining logic into TransactionalDistributionInterceptor and NonTransactional...
