At the moment, it is very easy for an application to start a huge number of putAsync operations and fill the transport executor s thread pool, delaying internal work such as state transfer. Increasing the size of the transport executor s thread pool won t work, because that would in turn fill the remote commands and JGroups  OOB thread pools, with the same effect.
If the cache async operations used a different thread pool, it would be possible to configure more  remoteCommandsThreadPool  threads than  asyncOperationsThreadPool  threads, avoiding this problem.
