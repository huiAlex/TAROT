I d like to add methods
Configuration.toProperties() and
GlobalConfiguration.toProperties()
that would return current configuration values in flat key value structure (e.g. java.util.Properties) where property keys would reflect names of configuration fields and structure would be reflected by extending the key prefix and dividing by dot. e.g. clustering.hash.numOwners=2
The least intrusive and maintenance demanding implementation is via Reflection.
The flat configuration would be exposed via JMX objects, e.g.
jboss.infinispan:type=Cache,name= testCache(dist_sync) ,manager= default ,component=Cache
attribute  configurationProperties
jboss.infinispan:type=CacheManager,name= default ,component=CacheManager
attribute  globalConfigurationProperties
This is a diagnostic output feature and doesn t affect the way how Infinispan is configured.
