The implementation of the  putForExternalRead  method ignores the  Metadata  parameter, instead of passing it on to the  putForExternalRead  method in the cache implementation. This is no doubt because the cache implementation previously didn t support  Metadata  for  putForExternalRead .
I will prepare a PR and attach it to this ticket shortly. It was a gargantuan effort to patch this up, as you ll see!
