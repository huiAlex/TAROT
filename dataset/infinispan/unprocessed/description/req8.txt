Implement a scripting manager which stores custom scripts in a dedicated cache. These scripts will be invoked with a user-specified binding (i.e. a set of named parameters).
This component should support all known  code  extension points: simple, tasks, distexec, map/reduce, listeners, etc.
The script type should be supported by the available JSR-223 scripting engines
