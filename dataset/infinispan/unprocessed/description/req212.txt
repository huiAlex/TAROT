There is an issue when starting up a set of nodes in a cluster where the coordinator has told the surviving members that state transfer has been disabled.  If rebalancing is disabled while the cluster is running it s disabled on all the
However, if a new set of nodes join afterwards, they don t know that rebalancing was disabled.
This has consequences if there is a new coordinator elected (like during a MERGE) from the set of newly-started nodes.
To prevent this and ensure the greatest probablility of success, a node joining should get the state of this flag from the response from the coordinator.
