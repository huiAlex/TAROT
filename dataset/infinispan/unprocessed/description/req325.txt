As mentioned on the mailing list, when doing
cache.withFlags(Flag.SKIP_REMOTE_LOOKUP).put( key, value )
this will cause a CacheLoaderInterceptor to try loading the data, there is no way to prevent this; this is a major performance issue when I m not interested in the return value of put.
Apparently SKIP_REMOTE_LOOKUP work only to prevent return values from other nodes, but there s not way to prevent loading from the store. SKIP_CACHE_STORE would correctly skip the read, but I actually want the value to be written to the store, just needing to avoid the read.
