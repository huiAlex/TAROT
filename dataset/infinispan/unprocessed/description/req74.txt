Rather than having separate startup scripts for memcached and hotrod, a single script should be used, which would take in a  protocol  parameter to determine which server module to start.
From my email to infinispan-dev:
I notice you have a memcached.sh script to start the memcached server.  I believe this should be something like startServer.sh, given that we are not actually starting memcached?
And perhaps the script could be reused for HotRod as well ... passing in a flag to specify which protocol to speak, perhaps something like:
$ startServer.sh -p memcached
or
$ startServer.sh -p hotrod
Perhaps org.infinispan.server.memcached.Main could be in the server/core module instead, and based on the protocol flag passed in, kick start the appropriate server?  WDYT?
