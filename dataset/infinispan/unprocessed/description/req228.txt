If an infinispan-server cluster is not longer reachable for some reason, i.e. network disconnect, the hot-rod client try to re-establish the lost connections.
The client library will retry this by a fixed calculation based on the max numbers of connections from the pool or 10 multiplied with the number of available servers.
This can lead in a very long time until the application can continue and react as it will wait for the read- or connect-timeout for each try.
To improve this behaviour there should be a configurable limit of retries per server and/or a timeout in total.
This will give the application the chance to handle a remote-cache failure and reply to the user instead of hanging for minutes (with the default settings)
