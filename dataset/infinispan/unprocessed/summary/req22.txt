Graceful shutdown should be supported 
Currently, killing any node will result in a rehash.  A mechanism for clean shutdown should also be supported, so that a rehash is  not  triggered.  Useful when the entire cluster is being intentionally brought down.
Need to think about how we do this; perhaps a LEAVE message that will prevent nodes triggering a rehash when a subsequent view change is detected.  This could be done programmatically via a  clean  parameter to  stop() , but we should explore alternatives here.
