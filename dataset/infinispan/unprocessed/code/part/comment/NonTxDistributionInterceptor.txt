/**
 * Non-transactional interceptor used by distributed caches that support concurrent writes.
 * It is implemented based on lock forwarding. E.g.
 * - 'k' is written on node A, owners(k)={B,C}
 * - A forwards the given command to B
 * - B acquires a lock on 'k' then it forwards it to the remaining owners: C
 * - C applies the change and returns to B (no lock acquisition is needed)
 * - B applies the result as well, releases the lock and returns the result of the operation to A.
 * 
 * Note that even though this introduces an additional RPC (the forwarding), it behaves very well in
 * conjunction with
 * consistent-hash aware hotrod clients which connect directly to the lock owner.
