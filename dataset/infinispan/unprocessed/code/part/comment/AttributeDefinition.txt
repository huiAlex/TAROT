/**
 *
 * AttributeDefinition. Defines the characteristics of a configuration attribute. It is used to
 * construct an actual {@link Attribute} holder.
 *
 * An attribute definition has the following characteristics:
 * 
 * A name
 * A default value or a value initializer
 * A type, which needs to be specified if it cannot be inferred from the default value, i.e.
 * when it is null
 * Whether an attribute is immutable or not, i.e. whether its value is constant after
 * initialization or it can be changed
 * A validator which intercepts invalid values
 *
