/**
 * Attribute. This class implements a configuration attribute value holder. A configuration attribute is defined by an {@link AttributeDefinition}.
 * An attribute contains an optional value (or defers to its AttributeDefinition for the default value). It is possible to determine whether
 * a value has been changed with respect to its initial value. An Attribute remains modifiable until it is protected. At which point it can only
 * be modified if its AttributeDefinition allows it to be mutable. Additionally it is possible to register listeners when values change so that
 * code can react to these changes.
