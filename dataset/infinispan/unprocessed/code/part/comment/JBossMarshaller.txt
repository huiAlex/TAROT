/**
 * A JBoss Marshalling based marshaller that is oriented at internal, embedded,
 * Infinispan usage. It uses of a custom object table for Infinispan based
 * Externalizer instances that are either internal or user defined.
 * 
 * The reason why this is implemented specially in Infinispan rather than resorting to Java serialization or even the
 * more efficient JBoss serialization is that a lot of efficiency can be gained when a majority of the serialization
 * that occurs has to do with a small set of known types such as {@link org.infinispan.transaction.xa.GlobalTransaction} or
 * {@link org.infinispan.commands.ReplicableCommand}, and class type information can be replaced with simple magic
 * numbers.
 * 
 * Unknown types (typically user data) falls back to Java serialization.
