/**
    * This map is used for performance reasons.  Essentially when an expiration event should not be raised this
    * map should be populated first.  The main examples are if an expiration is about to occur for that key or the
    * key will be removed or updated.  In the latter case we don't want to send an expiration event and then a remove
    * event when we could do just the removal.
