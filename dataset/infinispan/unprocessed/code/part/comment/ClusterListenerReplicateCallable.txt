/**
 * This DistributedCallable is used to install a {@link RemoteClusterListener} on the resulting node.  This class
 * also has checks to ensure that if the listener is attempted to be installed from more than 1 source only 1 will be
 * installed as well if a node goes down while installing will also remove the listener.
