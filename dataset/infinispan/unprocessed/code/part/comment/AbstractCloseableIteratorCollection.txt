/**
 * Abstract collection that uses an underlying Cache instance to do various operations.  This is useful for a backing
 * collection such as entrySet, keySet or values from the Map interface.  Implementors only need to implement individual
 * methods such as {@link Collection#contains(Object)}, {@link Collection#remove(Object)} and
 * {@link org.infinispan.commons.util.CloseableIteratorCollection#iterator()}.  The {@link Collection#add(Object)} by default will throw an
 * {@link java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException}.
