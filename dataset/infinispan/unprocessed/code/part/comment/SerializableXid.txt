/**
 * This xid implementation is needed because {@link javax.transaction.xa.Xid} is not {@link java.io.Serializable} and
 * we need to serialize it and send it over the network. As the KTA spec does not enforce in anyway the equals and hashcode methods on Xid
 * TM providers are expected to be able to cope with this Xid class when returned from XAResource's methods.
 *
 *  *  * @deprecated use {@link org.infinispan.commons.tx.XidImpl} instead.
