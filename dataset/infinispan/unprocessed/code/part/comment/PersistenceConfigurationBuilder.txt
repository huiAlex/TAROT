    * If true, data is only written to the cache store when it is evicted from memory, a phenomenon
    * known as 'passivation'. Next time the data is requested, it will be 'activated' which means
    * that data will be brought back to memory and removed from the persistent store. This gives you
    * the ability to 'overflow' to disk, similar to swapping in an operating system. 
    * 
    * If false, the cache store contains a copy of the contents in memory, so writes to cache result
    * in cache store writes. This essentially gives you a 'write-through' configuration.
