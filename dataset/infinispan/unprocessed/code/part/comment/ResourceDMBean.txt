/**
 * This class was entirely copied from JGroups 2.7 (same name there). Couldn't simply reuse it because JGroups does not
 * ship with MBean, ManagedAttribute and ManagedOperation.
 * 
 * The original JGroup's ResourceDMBean logic has been modified so that invoke() method checks whether the operation
 * called has been exposed as a {@link ManagedOperation}, otherwise the call fails. JGroups deviated from this logic on
 * purpose because they liked the fact that you could expose all class methods by simply annotating class with {@link
 * MBean} annotation.
