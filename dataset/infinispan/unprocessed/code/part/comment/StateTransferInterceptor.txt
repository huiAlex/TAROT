/**
 * This interceptor has two tasks:
 * 
 *    If the command's topology id is higher than the current topology id,
 *    wait for the node to receive transaction data for the new topology id.
 *    If the topology id changed during a command's execution, retry the command, but only on the
 *    originator (which replicates it to the new owners).
 * 
 *
 * If the cache is configured with asynchronous replication, owners cannot signal to the originator that they
 * saw a new topology, so instead each owner forwards the command to all the other owners in the new topology.
 *

/**
    * Special processing required for transaction commands.

/**
    * For non-tx write commands, we retry the command locally if the topology changed.
    * But we only retry on the originator, and only if the command doesn't have
    * the {@code CACHE_MODE_LOCAL} flag.
