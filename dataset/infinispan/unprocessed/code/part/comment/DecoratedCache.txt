/**
 * A decorator to a cache, which can be built with a specific set of {@link Flag}s.  This
 * set of {@link Flag}s will be applied to all cache invocations made via this decorator.
 * 
 * In addition to cleaner and more readable code, this approach offers a performance benefit to using
 * {@link AdvancedCache#withFlags(org.infinispan.context.Flag...)} API, thanks to
 * internal optimizations that can be made when the {@link Flag} set is unchanging.
 * 
 * Note that {@link DecoratedCache} must be the closest Delegate to the actual Cache implementation. All others
 * must delegate to this DecoratedCache.
