    <ClassComment>RemovableFunction  /** 
 * Placeholder interface used to describe a function that can be used as is for removal.  This is useful for allowing an iterator to use removal. &lt;p&gt; The resulting value should be able to be used by a remove call from the cache.  Thus users shouldn't ever need to use this interface directly since it would require knowing how the underlying data is stored and transferred.
