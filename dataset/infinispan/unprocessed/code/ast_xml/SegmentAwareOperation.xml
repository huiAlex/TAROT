 * This method will be invoked when the operation is known to be performing on a given set of segments and this node no longer owns 1 or many of them.  Returns whether the lost segment affected the results or not.  If stopIfLost is true then doneWithOperation will not be invoked as it would normally.
 * @param allSegmentsLost argument to tell the operation that if this segment affects that it should notperform any more operations if possible as all segments have been lost.
 * @return whether or not this operation was affected by the loss of segments
