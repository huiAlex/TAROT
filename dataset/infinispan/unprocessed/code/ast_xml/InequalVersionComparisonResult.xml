    <ClassComment>InequalVersionComparisonResult  /** 
 * Versions can be compared to each other to result in one version being before, after or at the same time as another version.  This is different from the JDK's  {@link Comparable} interface, which is much more simplistic in that itdoesn't differentiate between something that is the same versus equal-but-different.
