    <ClassComment>DataRehashed  /** 
 * This annotation should be used on methods that need to be notified when a rehash starts or ends. A "rehash" (or "rebalance") is the interval during which nodes are transferring data between each other. When the event with  {@code pre = false} is fired all nodes have received all data; Some nodes canstill keep old data, though - old data cleanup is executed after this event is fired. &lt;p/&gt; Methods annotated with this annotation should accept a single parameter, a  {@link DataRehashedEvent} otherwise a{@link IncorrectListenerException} will be thrown when registering your listener.&lt;p/&gt; Note that methods marked with this annotation will be fired &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; rehashing takes place, i.e., your method will be called twice, with  {@link Event#isPre()} being set to &lt;tt&gt;true&lt;/tt&gt; as well as &lt;tt&gt;false&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;p/&gt; Any exceptions thrown by the listener will abort the call. Any other listeners not yet called will not be called, and any transactions in progress will be rolled back.
