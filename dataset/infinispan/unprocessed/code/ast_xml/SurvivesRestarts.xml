    <ClassComment>SurvivesRestarts  /** 
 * This annotation is used for components that will be registered in the  {@link org.infinispan.factories.ComponentRegistry}, that are meant to be retained in the component registry even after the component registry is stopped.  Components annotated as such would not have to be recreated and rewired between stopping and starting a component registry. &lt;br /&gt; As a rule of thumb though, use of this annotation on components should be avoided, since resilient components are retained even after a component registry is stopped and consume resources.  Only components necessary for and critical to bootstrapping and restarting the component registry should be annotated as such.
