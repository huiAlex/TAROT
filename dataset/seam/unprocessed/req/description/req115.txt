Seamgen generates classes derived from EntityHome which often must be customized by the end user developer.  Currently there is no documentation, not even javadocs, for the various functions inherited from Home and EntityHome (what is the  contract  for the wire()/isWired() functions?  If a new instance needs to be initialized with default values, where should that be done (createInstance()?  wire()? somewhere else?).   How is getDefinedInstance() intended to be used?  Under what circumstances should setId() be called?
Seamgen is all well and good for getting a sort-of-working CRUD application up and running, but the generated files invariably need to be edited / adapted / customized and without documentation for how they are intended to be used, each end user developer must guess at what the seamgen framework intends. .
