Add a property of type Principal and another property (maybe of type Group ?) to Script.  The Principal should be used by the MockHttpServletRequest to represent and authenticated user.  The Group  property should be used by the MockHttpServletRequest to support the isUserInRole() implementation.
These properties ideally should be settable by overriding the setup() method of Script.
