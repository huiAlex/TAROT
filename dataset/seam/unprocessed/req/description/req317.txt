In an average Seam application we may use some or all of the following filters, which may grow to even more over time:
SeamRedirectFilter
SeamExceptionFilter
SeamMultipartFilter
SeamServletFilter
It would be nice to be able to configure a single master filter, SeamFilter, which wraps all of these filters.  We could possibly even make each of these filters application-scoped components, meaning they could be configured via components.xml instead of in web.xml. .
