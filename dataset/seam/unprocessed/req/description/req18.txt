Create an example of two seam WAR applications inside of an EAR.  There has been quite a bit of forum traffic on the subject and it would be good to nail down an example and document.  There may also be errors and other issue that need to be worked out.
An admin console type application to the standard booking application may be a good way to go.  It would be a real world/useful example.   .
