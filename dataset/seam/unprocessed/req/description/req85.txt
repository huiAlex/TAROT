I would like to extend org.jboss.seam.security.Identity class in order to integrate Seam with 3rd party libraries such as Acegi.
For this to work I need to overload the Identity subject. Since the subject attribute is private  and  Identity class access it always directly (doesn t use the getter)  and  there s no public or protected setter, I cannot override it.
Could Identity class me modified such as :
1. subject attribute is made protected OR
2. adding a protected setter attribute OR
3.  &#91;better solution I think&#93;  always acceeding to subject attribut via its getter.
This issue is related with the post
Thanks .
