I have a need where I would like to have an el expression in the view-id of a pageflow.  I ve looked a bit at themes; and while I might be able to do what I want by replacing the template.xhtml dynamically, I don t (at least initial) like indirection.
I believe the patch for this functionality is reletively trivial.  Altough, I very well could have missed something.  Basically, I  modified the Page.getViewId() method to evaulate the value returned and replace any el expressions.
I also modified the Number Guess example to use this feature.
I have attached an initial patch as a proof of concept if it is of any interest to the Seam developers.
