Page actions are incredibly useful, but sometimes they can get in the way during a postback. I would like to see a postback attribute added to the &lt;action&gt; tag that can be used to disable the action on postback. It s possible using a conditional, but it is ugly and a lot of typing.
Here is the logic that would go into Pages.java
private boolean isPostBack(FacesContext facesContext)
{
return facesContext.getExternalContext().getRequestParameterMap().
containsKey(ResponseStateManager.VIEW_STATE_PARAM);
}
The conditional alternative would be:
&lt;action execute= #
{component.action}
if= #
{empty param}
/&gt; .
