It would be really cool to tie in EL expressions directly with Seam remoting.  For example, take this method call:
Seam.Component.getInstance( helloAction ).sayHello(nameValue, sayHelloCallback);
instead, this could be rewritten (and tied into the page context) like this:
Seam.Remoting.pageContext.set( name , nameValue);
Seam.Remoting.evaluate( #
{helloAction.sayHello(name)}
, sayHelloCallback);
This is not a perfect example, however it demonstrates the potential of this feature.  Plus it makes remoting more consistent with the rest of Seam. .
