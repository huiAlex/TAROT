We need to allow easy redirection to urls with parameters. The  redirect  component will have the following operations:
Redirect.setParameter(String, Object)
Redirect.setViewId(String)
Redirect.captureCurrentRequest()
Redirect.push()
Redirect.pop()
Redirect.redirect()
Redirect is a conversation-scope component that has a stack of viewId+parameters, so you can, for example, easily redirect to a login page from a Seam page action, and then redirect back to the requested page. .
