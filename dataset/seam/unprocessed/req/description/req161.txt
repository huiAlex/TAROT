It would be nice to provide a way to globally configure the flushmode setting. Say, a way to configure begins to use flushmode=MANUAL by default. Maybe this could be configured in components.xml.  This would save a lot of what is generally boilerplate configuration since this is common usage.  Perhaps, I could specify:
&lt;core:manager conversation-flushmode= MANUAL  /&gt; .
