SeamInterceptor should detect when no seam contexts have been set up, and set up at least an EVENT context. In practice, we really want some way to also set up CONVERSATION and PROCESS contexts, but this is a bit problematic, since we have no good way to pass in the conversation id and process/task ids. Need to think about that one... .
