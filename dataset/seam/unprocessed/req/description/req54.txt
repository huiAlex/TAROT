Currently, the only way to define exception rollback rules is @ApplicationException, which is a dependency to EJB3. For some reason I closed   without a better solution for this. There really needs to be two things:
(1) An API to call to set the current tx to rollback only
(2) some kind of @Exception annotation that allows control of rollback and, potentially, ending the conversation
We should possibly even deprecate the end() member of @HttpError and @Redirect if we have this new thing. .
