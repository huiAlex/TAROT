Create a Seam resource servlet for serving non-jsf resources, such as javascript, images, css, etc.  It should replace SeamRemotingServlet and CaptchaServlet, and accept requests for something like  /seam/resource/* , and depending on the path delegate control to various resource providers, e.g:
/seam/resource/remoting - delegate to Seam Remoting
/seam/resource/captcha - delegate to Captcha image provider
/seam/resource/jsfcontrol - delegate to JSF Control javascript provider (JS resources for selectDate, etc). .
