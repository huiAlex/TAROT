It s absolutely critical that the HotDeployFilter only be applied to JSF requests or else the scanning that it does occurs for every related requested by the page. However, currently none of the XML schemas for the component descriptor recognize this filter as a configurable element. Here is how it has to be configured now:
&lt;component name= org.jboss.seam.debug.hotDeployFilter &gt;
&lt;property name= urlPattern &gt;*.seam&lt;/property&gt;
&lt;/component&gt;
I would like to do one of two things.
#1
Change the component name from org.jboss.seam.debug.hotDeployFilter to org.jboss.seam.web.hotDeployFilter (but still keep it in jboss-seam-debug.jar), then add the hot-deploy-filter element to web.xsd. We would get this:
&lt;web:hot-deploy-filter url-pattern= *.seam /&gt;
We could even consider moving this filter into jboss-seam.jar because honestly it is so lightweight and really has everything to do with the core and is already controlled by the debug mode flag in Seam.
#2
Keep the component name as is and introduce a new namespace   and a corresponding package-info.java and debug.xsd. Then add the hot-deploy-filter to debug.xsd. We would get this:
&lt;debug:hot-deploy-filter url-pattern= *.seam /&gt;
I really hate solution #2. The only redeeming quality is that it doesn t break applications that might rely on this component name. But then again, it would only affect debug mode, not production apps. .
