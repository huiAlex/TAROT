Currently org.jboss.seam.navigation.Pages is a major pain point since some of the methods are marked private and some are static (don t know why).
For example, selectDataModelRow() is private and it s got this line  if ( index&lt;dataModel.getRowCount() )  in it which I don t think is really necessary. This caused a lot of pain for us when we were trying to integrate it with RichFaces ExtendedDataModel and DataScroller. Basically when you re getting ranges from the database, the RowCount would query the database. So we had to avoid using @DataModel and @DataModelSelection completely. I know I can override installing the Pages component, but then I have to copy/paste pretty much everything from Pages to our CustomPages just to change a line, talk about anti-DRY. I can give you more details on this if you want.
In addition, the other not so cool method is  public static String getRequestScheme(FacesContext facesContext)  which determines if a request is secure by looking at the URL. There are scenarios that you would want to override this method. Consider the case when you have an SSL accelerator. The accelerator will terminate the SSL connection and create a new HTTP connection to the app server. Now you have the option to pass an HTTP header when the accelerator decrypts HTTPS packets so you re app server knows that the request was originally secure (so no need to redirect, or anything).
This class has not been designed that well for extension and I think it can be improved.
