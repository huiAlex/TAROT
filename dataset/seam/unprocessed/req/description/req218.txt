If the Jpa Permission Store is used and a rule-based-permission-resolver and a persistent-permission-resolver is configured, the order for looking up permissions is:
1) DroolsFile, 2)persistent-permission-resolver 3) Other permission-resolvers what implments the permission-resolver interface
It would be nice if it s possible to change the order for looking up the permissions
.
