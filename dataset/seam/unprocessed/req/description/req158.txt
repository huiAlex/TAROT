In AbstractFilter.java, someone took this from Tomcat:
/**
Pattern matching code, adapted from Tomcat. This method checks to see if
the specified path matches the specified pattern.
@param request ServletRequest The request containing the path
@return boolean True if the path matches the pattern, false otherwise
*/
public boolean isMappedToCurrentRequestPath(ServletRequest request)
What we really need is url-pattern=
{regex} . Drop the Tomcat pattern nonsense with the wildcards and use a regex. Probably needs to be backwards compatible now with an additional url-pattern-regex= {regex}
property.
Usecase: Filter /servlets/* AND  /Feed/*.
.
