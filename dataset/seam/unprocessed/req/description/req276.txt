The SynchronizationInterceptor currently contains
public boolean isInterceptorEnabled()
{
// JBSEAM-4943
return getComponent().isSynchronize() &amp;&amp; getComponent().getType() != ComponentType.STATEFUL_SESSION_BEAN;
}
The logic should be moved to the Component.initSynchronize method and a warning should be generated telling the developer that the annotation is being ignored if the @Synchronized annotation is present and the component is a SFSB. .
