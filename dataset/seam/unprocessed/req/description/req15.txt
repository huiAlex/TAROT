In our project we would like to use the JBoss Seam Scanner class to browse over our EJB classes in search for our custom @Config annotations (see  ). Unfortunately the handleItem method on the Scanner class is only package visible. This prevents generic reusability of this really powerful Scanner class. Could you guys make the handleItem method public?
Thanks,
Frank. .
