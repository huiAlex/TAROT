Currently Seam does no special processing for qualified names. The only way to alias a name to a shorter name is via &lt;factory&gt;.
We should provide:
global import of a qualifier in components.xml
import into a component or Java package via @Import
import into a page (ie. a view id) via pages.xml
.
