I have recently run into a requirement where it would be nice to have descriptions applied to wildcard view-ids. For example, if I have the following:
Code:
&lt;page view-id= /section/*  conversation-required= true &gt;
&lt;description&gt;Section 1&lt;/description&gt;
&lt;/page&gt;
Section 1 would be the description for all pages in /section/* unless specified otherwise in a higher precedence page definition. .
