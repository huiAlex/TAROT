When parsing XML files that we don t control, like ejb-jar.xml it s possible for the parser to make network connections to resolve DTDs.  Rather than trying to maintain a local cache, I am adding a safe parsing mode which will completely ignore external references.  If the external DTD is critical to parsing (default attributes, for example), the DTD still can be cached and the document parsed normally. .
