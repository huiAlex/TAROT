The possibility to kill the conversation stack with the  s:conversationPropagation   is missing in v2.1.1.CR1.
It is possible to do that via annotation @End(root=true), the API or with pages.xml, but not  with the  s:conversationPropagation   tag that may use to begin/end/join etc... a conversation
Maybe by adding another enum for  type  like  endAll  ?: &lt;s:conversationPropagation type= endAll  /&gt; .
