When developing JSF converters and validators you are noticed that both of them have a way to add a FacesMessage when throwing the Exception (ConverterException and ValidatorException respectively), the validator exception has this constructor:
ValidatorException(javax.faces.application.FacesMessage)
Currently there is FacesMessages.createFacesMessage(..) method which returns a FacesMessage, but that method does not work if you wanna get a message from a resource bundle key (when working with i18n apps).
So, please add a new method which allows us to get a FacesMessage using a resource bundle key, something like:
public static FacesMessage createFacesMessageFromResourceBundle(Severity severity, String key, Objec
t... params)
.
