It would be nice to be able to match up a DataModelSelection with a DataModel that is provided by an entity-query.  As of now a deployment error is thrown.
Use Case:  If a data table is driven by an entity-query, the only way currently to select a row is by passing the var using the Extended EL Seam provides.  The extended EL is not compatible with some component libraries (Trinidad) and it is very ugly to go through component bindings to get the current value of the selected row.  It would be nice to hook a DataModelSelection to the entity-query.
Something like this
components.xml
&lt;framework:entity-query name= allUsers
ejbql= select u from User u /&gt;
facelets page
&#91;code&#93;
&lt;tr:table id= user_table  value= #
{allUsers}
var= user &gt;
&lt;tr:column id= user_column &gt;
&lt;f:facet name= header &gt;
&lt;tr:outputText id= user_header  value= Customer /&gt;
&lt;/f:facet&gt;
&lt;tr:commandLink id= user_link  text= #
{useruserName}
actionListener= #
{attachUser.done}
/&gt;
&lt;/tr:column&gt;
&lt;/tr:table&gt;
Seam Bean
@DataModelSelection( allUsers )
List &lt;User&gt; userList;
.
