It would be nice if redirect directives would allow for message severities to be defined for them.  This happens a lot for scenarios where exceptions cause a redirect.  Instead of the user seeing an INFO message, we want them to see an ERROR or WARN FacesMessage.
For instance, if a severity flag was added to the message, we could do this in pages.xml using the following:
&lt;exception class= org.jboss.seam.security.AuthorizationException &gt;
&lt;end-conversation /&gt;
&lt;redirect view-id= /myglobal/unprot/pages/login.xhtml  &gt;
&lt;message severity= error &gt;
Login failed. Please try again.
&lt;/message&gt;
&lt;/redirect&gt;
&lt;/exception&gt;
.
