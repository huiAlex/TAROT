don t add parameter to Url if value is null.
When the value of a parameter declared inside of a Seam UI command control using &lt;f:param&gt; is null, then it should not be appended to the URL. Currently, it is appended with a blank value. The problem is that there is a difference between an empty string (blank value) and not being present. Additionally, by setting the value to null (or leaving off the value attribute), it provides a way to suppress a parameter from being added the URL.
Assuming the link was defined as follows:
&lt;s:link view= /UserEdit.xhtml &gt;
&lt;f:param name= userId /&gt;
&lt;/s:link&gt;
The URL should be:
/UserEdit.seam
This might override a page parameter for instance. .
