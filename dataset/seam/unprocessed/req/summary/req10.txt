Specify HTTP headers in pages.xml.
Eg. it would be very useful to be able to do:
&lt;page view-id= document.xhtml  expires= 20000 /&gt;
Where expires gives a number in seconds, which is converted by Seam to an absolute time.
But more generally, we want to be able to do stuff like:
&lt;page view-id= document.xml &gt;
&lt;header name= Content-Type &gt;test/xml&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;/page&gt; .
