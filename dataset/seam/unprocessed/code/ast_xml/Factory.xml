    <ClassComment>Factory  /** 
 * Marks a method as a factory method for a context variable. A factory method is called whenever no value is bound to the named context variable, and is expected to initialize the value of the context variable. There are two kinds of  factory methods. Factory methods with void return type are  responsible for outjecting a value to the context variable.  Factory methods which return a value do not need to  explicitly ouject the value, since Seam will bind the returned value to the specified scope. This annotation supports use of the Seam "factory component" pattern.
