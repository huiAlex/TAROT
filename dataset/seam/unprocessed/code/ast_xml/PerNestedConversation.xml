    <ClassComment>PerNestedConversation  /** 
 * Limit the scope of a CONVERSATION-scoped component to just the parent conversation in which it was  instantiated. The component instance will not be visible to nested child conversations, which will get their own instance. Warning: this is ill-defined, since it implies that a component will be visible for some part of a request cycle, and invisible after that. It is not recommended that applications use this feature!
