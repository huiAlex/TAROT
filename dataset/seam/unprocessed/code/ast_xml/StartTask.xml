 * Marks a method as causing jBPM  {@link org.jbpm.taskmgmt.exe.TaskInstance task}to be started. The jBPM  {@link org.jbpm.context.exe.ContextInstance} is associated with the BUSINESS_PROCESS scope and the  {@link org.jbpm.taskmgmt.exe.TaskInstance} is associated with a newconversation, unless the annotated method returns a null outcome. &lt;p/&gt; Note that both  {@link BeginTask} and {@link StartTask} have effectbefore invocation of the intercepted method in that they are both about setting up appropriate  {@link org.jbpm.context.exe.ContextInstance}for the current  {@link org.jboss.seam.contexts.BusinessProcessContext}; {@link StartTask} however, also has effect after method invocationas that is the time it actually marks the task as started.
