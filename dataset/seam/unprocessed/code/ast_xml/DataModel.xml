    <ClassComment>DataModel  /** 
 * Outjects a collection to the same scope as the owning component (or to the EVENT scope in the case of a stateless component), after wrapping as a JSF DataModel (a List as a ListDataModel, a Map as a MapDataModel, a Set as a SetDataModel, an array as an  ArrayDataModel). Note that the List, Map, Set or array will be re-wrapped and re-outjected each time the current component value is different to the value held by the context variable as determined by calling equals() on the  underlying collection.
