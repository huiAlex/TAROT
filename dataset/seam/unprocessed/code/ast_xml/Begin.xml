    <ClassComment>Begin  /** 
 * A version of the core @Begin annotation which can be placed on wicket component constructors. The wicket interceptor will scan for this as well as the default @Begin annotation.  They are identical in function, but java does not allow annotation inheritance.  In addition, the  deprecated ifOutcome and id methods have been removed, and the pageflow method as well, as it is not as yet supported in wicket.
