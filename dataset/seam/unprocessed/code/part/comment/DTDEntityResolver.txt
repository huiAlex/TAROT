/**
 * An {@link EntityResolver} implementation which attempts to resolve
 * various systemId URLs to local classpath lookups
 * Any systemId URL beginning with http://jboss.org/schema/seam/ is
 * searched for as a classpath resource in the classloader which loaded the
 * Seam classes.
 * Any systemId URL using classpath as the scheme (i.e. starting
 * with classpath:// is searched for as a classpath resource using first
 * the current thread context classloader and then the classloader which loaded
 * the Seam classes.
 * 
 * 
 * Any entity references which cannot be resolved in relation to the above
 * rules result in returning null, which should force the SAX reader to
 * handle the entity reference in its default manner.
