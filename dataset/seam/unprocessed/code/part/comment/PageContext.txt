/**
 * The page context allows you to store state during a request that
 * renders a page, and access that state from any postback request
 * that originates from that page. The state is destroyed at the 
 * end of the second request. During the RENDER_RESPONSE phase,
 * the page context instance refers to the page that is about to
 * be rendered. Prior to the INVOKE_APPLICATION phase, it refers
 * to the page that was the source of the request. During the
 * INVOKE_APPLICATION phase, set() and remove() manipulate the
 * context of the page that is about to be rendered, while get()
 * returns values from the page that was the source of the request.
