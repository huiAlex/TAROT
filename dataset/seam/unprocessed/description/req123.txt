Currently, it is not possible to assign the value of a Enum property using the component configuration mechanism (components.xml or *.component.xml). Enums are very easy to support since Java 5+ has a built-in mechanism for translating strings into Enums. This support can be added by registering an EnumConverter in Conversions. It works much the same way as the JSF enum converter. .
