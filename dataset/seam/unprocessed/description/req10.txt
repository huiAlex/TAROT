More flexible mapping of URLs to view ids.
For example, I want to be able to use a URL like this:
To get me to archive.xhtml with a request parameter 200306 (not really a request parameter, but we could try to abstract that so that it can be used with @RequestParameter).
Not sure if this is possible without changing the JSF implementation. .
