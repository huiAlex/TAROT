At the moment this can be achieved by
Extracting the parent conversation id from Manager
Calling endBeforeRedirect()
Doing a Redirect.execute() manually.
Would be handy just to be able to do  Conversation.endAndRedirect( true )
Either that or have a method to set the destroyBeforeRedirect flag.
Conversation.setDestroyBeforeRedirect( true );
Conversation.endAndRedirect(); .
