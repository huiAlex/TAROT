Would it be possible to get the Seam i18n features to scan for multiple resource bundles, so that common resources can be shared across mutliple applications?
Here s a few ways this could be accomplished:
1) Rename the default bundle  messages.properties  to  seam-messages.properties , and scan for multiple seam-messages.properties in the EAR.
2) Add a new property name, or change the resourceBundle.bundleName property, to handle a delimited list of resourceBundles. So the default implementation uses a single bundle  messages.properties , but by adding a configuration property you can get it to scan multiple resource bundles in the order specified.
e.g.
resourceBundle.bundleName=Messages.properties,GlobalMessages.properties
3) Implement a cascading scheme, similar to the sample posted in the forum. .
