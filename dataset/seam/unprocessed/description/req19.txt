We need the following to allow Seam users to optimize their application s HTTP communication:
A new method called selectOutputStream() in AbstractResource that is able to GZIP content if supported by the browser, transparently to the actual AbstractResource implementation. Although this is the job of Tomcat, it sometimes for unknown reasons does not compress a resource representation.
A new CacheControlFilter that provides cache-control headers, configurable in components.xml:
&lt;web:cache-control-filter name= resourcesCacheControlFilter  regex-url-pattern= .*(\.gif|\.png|\.jpg|\.jpeg|\.css|\.js)  value= max-age=86400 /&gt; &lt;!-- 1 day --&gt;
A new alternative to AbstractResource called ConditionalAbstractResource which provides the sendConditional() method that can, using entity tags and last modified timestamps, return a 304 Not Modified instead of the actual resource representation. This is used by browsers after an item in the local cache expires, Seam users can subclass ConditionalAbstractResource to define the entity tag and last modified validation conditions.
