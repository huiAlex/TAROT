I think seam team should consider building seam 2.5 version so we can upgrade our old project to jsf2.0,ejb3.1,hibernate 3.6,beanvalidation,glassfish3 or jboss6 and get rid of hibernate3.2 validation and richfaces3 dependcy.
I have upgraded my old project a few months ago from seam2.2  to use jsf2.1,hibernate 3.6,beanvalidation,granite-seam21,spring3.05 under tomcat 7.0.5-dev and used in the production environment.I test it on glassfish v3.1 and jboss6 but not test ejb.
If considered i can provide my patch to seam team as a reference or push full source code to github with your team permission.
Please consider.
