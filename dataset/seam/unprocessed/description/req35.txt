There are situations where I would like to be able to destroy the entire conversation stack if a particular action occurs (say a user cancels everything during a nested conversation, an exception occurs during a nested conversation, etc). I am currently accomplishing this through the following:
private void endRootConversation() {
Conversation conversation = Conversation.instance();
while(conversation.isNested())
{
conversation.root();
}
conversation.endBeforeRedirect();
}
I would prefer to say something like @End(root=true) or specifying conversationPropogation= endRoot .  Similar discussions on the forum are:
