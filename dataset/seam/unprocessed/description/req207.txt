I think org.jboss.seam.core.Validators should implement and interface, so that it could be possible to replace it with one that doesn t use org.hibernate.validator.ClassValidator I guess with that we could say that Seam can be used in a 100% free of Hibernate way
I really like Hibernate, but sometimes, for really simple projects, or for projects full of interactions with stored procedures , it might be overkill or innapropiate, so it would be nice to be able to use Seam without having any Hibernate dependencies. .
