use a transaction failed event rather than message.
A FacesMessage should not be added by the SeamPhaseListener when the transaction fails. Instead, it should raise an event that would be observed by a component named FacesTransactionEvents. That observer would then add the FacesMessage to the response. This allows developers to override the behavior or perhaps add a JSF or log message.
