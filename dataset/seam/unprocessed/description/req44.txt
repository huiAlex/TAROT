&lt;s:download value=#{FileManager.getFileById( 10 )  contentType= #
{FileManager.contentType}
/&gt;
We re going to create new (more general component) which allows the user to download a  file (any resource, Excel file, Document whatever).
The plan is to create a new UI component named UIDownload which has attributes like value, contentType (some more?).
1) UIDownload a backing bean (value) (is this still valid word in the seam world?) to generate the data ( allow byte, OutputStreams ?).
2) UIDownload creates DownloadResource which is stored in DownloadStore.
3) UIDownload generates HTML which redirects the browser to ResourceServlet
4) ResourceServlet then uses DownloadResource to get hold of the data and the pushes it to browser
The reason for this is that we re building portlets with Seam and it s impossible to  download  files from a portal environment without additional servlet and we think it s good idea to reuse existing stuff.
Patch coming soon (if we can make it work
.
