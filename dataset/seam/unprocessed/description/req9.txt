Only enable ManagedEntityInterceptor when needed.
The MEI is only needed for:
JavaBeans in a cluster that are conversation scoped
or
EJBs that are conversation scoped
Add some configuration to &lt;core:init /&gt; to allow the user to enable clustering mode (or autodetect) and upgrade the isInterceptorEnabled method to take account of this. .
