I want to inject a request parameter to a bean like bellow using expression:
@In(value= #
{param.id}
, required=false)
private Long id;
However, Seam gives error java.lang.IllegalArgumentException because the param value is of type String, which doesn t match the field s type Long. I think for injections, Seam should do some basic conversions from String to primitives and primitive wrappers. .
