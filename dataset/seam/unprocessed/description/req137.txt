I am having some political problems getting this into Tomahawk (which is living in a java 1.4 world).  The work is here and it s tested.  I think this would be a good addition to Seam, considering that Seam has done so much w/ the other stuff that came out in 1.5.   I intend to document this, so please advise on what the protocol is.  Also, I looked around the code base and couldn t find a faces-config to register these. .
