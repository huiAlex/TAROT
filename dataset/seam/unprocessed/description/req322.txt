As a simpler alternative to &lt;restrict&gt;#
{identity.loggedIn}
&lt;/restrict&gt; + &lt;exception class= org.jboss.seam.security.NotLoggedInException &gt;, we should allow you to use:
&lt;pages login-view-id= /login.xhtml &gt;
&lt;page view-id= /main.xhtml  login-required= true &gt;
&lt;/page&gt;
&lt;pages&gt;
Just like we have with conversation-required today. This would use special code in Page.enter(), instead of exception handling to do its work.
It would also add a message to the FacesContext (just like Manager.noConversation() does today). .
