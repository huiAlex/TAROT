Currently only java.util.Date and descendent are supported as type for fields containing date values. Objects of type java.util.Calendar are also commonly used and in case of legacy code these objects cannot be (directly) used by Seam Remoting.
It would be an improvement if objects with Calendar fields could be used on the client side. .
