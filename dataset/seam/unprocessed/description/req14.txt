Make LocalDispatcher not dependent on javax.ejb.Timer.
I m attempting to create a port of the @Asynchronous annotation for Spring. ( )  It would appear the correct way to do this would be to create a Spring Dispatcher component that would override the core Dispatcher component.  However, the LocalDispatcher Interface is dependent on javax.ejb.Timer  I can probably wrap my spring dispatch implementation into the javax.ejb.Timer but it would be nice if a seam version of javax.ejb.Timer were created so that the j2ee.jar would not be required for users who wish to use @Asynchronous under a web container. .
