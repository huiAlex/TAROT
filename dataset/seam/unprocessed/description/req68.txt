We already have an ArrayDataModel, let s let it be used with @DataModel.
We should also allow use of @DataModel with a Map. Essentially, this would result in a ListDataModel&lt;Map.Entry&gt;, but @DataModelSelectionIndex would know to inject the map key instead of the row index, and @DataModelSelection would know to inject the map value instead of the Map.Entry.
We should probably even allow use with a Set. In this case, @DataModelSelectionIndex is not defined. .
