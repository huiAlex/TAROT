I m trying to bind a Map entry to h:inputText. The code below successfully extracts the value for the key when the page is loaded, but when I submit it, the page reloads with an error alongside the field:  model validation failed:String index out of range: -1 . It appears that the s:validateAll that wraps h:inputText does not work properly when used this way??
(Gavin suggested that I submit this to JIRA - see forum thread reference)
From the .xhtml
Code:
&lt;h:form id= dataEntryForm &gt;
&lt;h:inputText id= asdf  required= true  value= #
{biomarkers}
/&gt;
&lt;/h:form&gt;
From the session bean:
Code:
@Out
Map&lt;String, String&gt; biomarkers = new HashMap&lt;String, String&gt;();
// method code that preps the Map prior to being used
biomarkers.put( waist ,  33.3 );
.
