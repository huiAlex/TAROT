Create a Seam project using  Jboss Tools 2.1.2.
Create a new Seam Form with name  SeamDateForm
Open the file SeamDateForm.java and change the value from Integer to java.util.Date.
Right-click seamDateForm.xhtml and click Run As... -&gt; Run On Server.
Write something in the form (like for example some random string  dfasdf )
You will get the error: Conversion Error setting value  dfasdf  for  null Converter .
Now create a Date Converter, as the one included in the attached test case project (BTW it inherits from javax.faces.convert.DateTimeConverter).
Stop the application (just to be 100% sure everything gets loaded correctly)
Again:
Right-click seamDateForm.xhtml and click Run As... -&gt; Run On Server.
Write something in the form (like for example some random string  dfasdf )
Now you get the right error: value must be a date, eg. 10/13/2008.
Of course it not only fails when you write a random string, even if you write a correct date, like 01/01/2001, you will get an error that says: Conversion Error setting value  01/01/2001  for  null Converter . But if you write your own converter (for example inheriting from javax.faces.convert.DateTimeConverter) everything works fine.
I think Seam should use javax.faces.convert.DateTimeConverter by default, I shouldn t need to create my own converter. .
