Seam does not provide any notification when an out of date schema or DTD is used in pages.xml, the file is transparently downloaded from the jboss website with every time a page is viewed, resulting in a major performance degradation. Seam should provide some indication to the developer that this is happening (probably throw an exception, I cannot think of any use case where you would want this behavior ).  .
